"""Logging bootstrap for platform-spawned task processes.

A task container runs its entrypoint directly (``python -m <task module>``),
so nothing configures the root logger the way a service's startup does. With
no root handler Python falls back to :data:`logging.lastResort`: WARNING and
above reach stderr as bare messages with no timestamp, level or logger name,
and INFO/DEBUG are dropped outright. A job that fails without raising can
therefore produce completely empty logs.

:func:`configure_task_logging` closes that gap for every task dispatched
through :func:`~nemo_platform_plugin.tasks.dispatcher.run_task`.

Lookup order for the provider
-----------------------------

Mirrors :mod:`nemo_platform_plugin.client_provider` and
:mod:`nemo_platform_plugin.sdk_provider`, for the same reason: it lets the
platform supply a richer implementation without ``nemo-platform-plugin`` ever
depending on ``nmp-common``.

1. **Explicit override** - set via :func:`set_task_logging_provider` (tests).
2. **Entry-point discovery** - scans the ``nemo.logging_provider`` group.
   When ``nmp-common`` is installed (every platform image), its provider is
   picked up and task output becomes the same structured stream the services
   emit, so log aggregation treats the two alike.
3. **Built-in default** - :class:`DefaultTaskLoggingProvider`, a plain stderr
   handler. Covers local development and any image without ``nmp-common``.

Unlike the client and SDK providers, a provider that fails to load here is
downgraded to the default rather than raised: logging is diagnostic
scaffolding, and failing a task because its logging setup broke would destroy
the very evidence needed to debug it.
