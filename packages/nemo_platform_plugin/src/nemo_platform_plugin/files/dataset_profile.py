"""The stored contract for the dataset profiler.

A ``DatasetProfile`` is machine-owned metadata the profiler computes once, at the Files layer, so
every consumer reads one typed description of a dataset instead of downloading and re-inspecting it.

The profile has two stored layers:

* **structure** — predominantly facts: file layout, splits, the derived row schema (``features``),
  and per-column ``stats``. The one inference living here is the ``FeatureSchema.semantic_role``
  marker stacked on the feature node it describes.
* **classification** — an objective description of what the data *is*: ``dataset_type``, the
  ``format`` / ``prompt_form`` axes, and ``verifiability``.

Vocabularies (``dataset_type``, ``semantic_role``, ``modality``, ...) are open ``str`` values with
documented canonical sets, not closed enums: only known values are emitted, but consumers must
tolerate unknown ones so the vocabulary can grow without a breaking change. Pydantic's default
``extra="ignore"`` gives the same forward-compatibility for unknown *fields*.

This module is pydantic-only — no platform dependencies — so the profiler can import it as a
standalone contract and ``DatasetMetadataContent`` can later carry it as a typed field.
