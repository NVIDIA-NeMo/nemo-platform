"""The stored contract for the dataset profiler.

A ``DatasetProfile`` is machine-owned metadata the profiler computes once, at the Files layer, so
every consumer reads one typed description of a dataset instead of downloading and re-inspecting it.
It has two stored layers:

* **structure** -- predominantly facts: file layout, splits, the derived row schema (``features``)
  and per-column ``stats``. The one detected attribute here is ``FeatureSchema.semantic_role``.
* **classification** -- what the data *is*: the ``candidates`` a partition's roles satisfy, the
  ``format`` / ``prompt_form`` axes, and ``verifiability``.

Vocabularies (``candidates`` entries, ``semantic_role``, ``modality``, ...) are open ``str`` values
with documented canonical sets, not closed enums: only known values are emitted, but consumers must
tolerate unknown ones so the vocabulary can grow without a breaking change. Pydantic's default
``extra="ignore"`` gives the same forward-compatibility for unknown *fields*.

It lives in a shared package rather than with the profiler because the Files service stores and
serves a profile as its own entity, so a deployment that installs no profiler still needs the type
to deserialize its own rows. The module is pydantic-only, so the profiler imports it standalone and
Files will import it as the type it persists -- that second half is why it lives here, not something
that has happened yet: today the profiler and these tests are its only importers, which is the same
reason ``PROFILE_SCHEMA_VERSION`` is still 1.0. A profile is a separate entity from fileset
metadata, so writing one cannot clobber an unrelated metadata edit."""
