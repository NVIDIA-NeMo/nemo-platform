"""Cross-plugin contract for sandbox-runtime image requirements.

A sandbox runtime (e.g. OpenShell) runs an agent image under a supervisor that
imposes requirements on the image: a dedicated non-root user resolved by name,
extra OS packages for its network/policy setup, and so on. Those requirements
are *provider* knowledge, but the *packager* (``nemo agents package``) is what
physically bakes them into the image.

To keep the packager provider-agnostic, a provider plugin registers one
:class:`SandboxImageProfile` under the ``nemo.sandbox_profiles`` entry-point
group; the packager discovers it by name (via
:func:`nemo_platform_plugin.discovery.discover_sandbox_profiles`) and renders
whatever it is handed. The packager never imports the provider.

These are plain, dependency-light dataclasses so a provider can describe its
profile without importing the runtime's heavy client libraries.
