"""How a local storage path is resolved, and which state it keeps together.

Regression: ``NMP_DATA_DIR`` relocates the entity-store database, but the bundled local
configurations pinned the literal blob location, so a run with it set produced a *half*
isolated instance — database in the chosen directory, blobs in the default one. That is worse
than an un-isolated instance: it looks isolated, and wiping the chosen directory silently
leaves the blobs behind.
