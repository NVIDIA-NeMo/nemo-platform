"""The union of candidate producers accepted as an evaluation ``target``.

This union spans three sibling modules and belongs to none of them, so it lives here rather than
in one member. It cannot live in the ``values`` barrel either: that surface is lazy, exposing
``Model``/``Agent`` only through ``_LAZY_ATTRS``, while a ``|`` union needs the real classes at
import time.
