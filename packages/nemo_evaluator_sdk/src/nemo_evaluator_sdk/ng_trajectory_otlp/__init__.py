"""Project NeMo-Gym rollout records onto OTLP spans.

Self-contained on purpose: nothing here imports the rest of this SDK, and its only dependency is
``opentelemetry-proto``, so the projection can be lifted into its own distribution if a producer
outside the evaluator ever wants it. Keep it that way.
