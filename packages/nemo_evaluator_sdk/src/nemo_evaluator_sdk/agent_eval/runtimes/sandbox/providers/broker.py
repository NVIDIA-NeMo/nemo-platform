"""A :class:`SandboxProvider` backed by a ``sandboxed-gym`` episode broker.

Where the Docker and Compose providers drive a container runtime on the host, this one is an HTTP
client. The broker holds the backend credential and enforces policy -- approved images, TTL and
concurrency caps, egress -- so this process never holds one; a local PoC found that putting stock
OpenSandbox credentials on the untrusted side lets ``provider_options`` escalate to socket or host
mounts, which is what the broker exists to prevent (sandboxed-GRPO RFC §6.7).

That split is also why this module imports only ``sandboxed_gym.wire``: the request and response
models, so client and server cannot drift. The broker, its backends and NeMo-Gym all live on the
far side of the HTTP boundary, in whatever job runs the broker.

Deployment note: nothing in this repository starts a broker yet. Customizer runs one as a Ray actor
inside the training pod, which does not transfer to an eval job. Until that is settled, point
``broker_url`` at a broker you started.
