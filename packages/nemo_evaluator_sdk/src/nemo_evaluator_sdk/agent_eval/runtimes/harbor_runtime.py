"""Harbor-backed :class:`AgentTaskRunner` for the agent-eval pipeline.

Harbor already runs trials in (Docker) environments, retries them, and writes a
documented results tree: one ``<task>__<hash>/result.json`` per trial under the
job directory. This runtime adapts that tree into SDK :class:`AgentEvalTrial`
objects so an :class:`AgentEvaluator` can score and report Harbor runs through the
same seam as any other runtime.

Two ways to drive it:

* **Native** — pass a :class:`HarborRuntimeConfig` and a dataset directory; the
  runtime builds Harbor's ``JobConfig`` and runs it itself. The one-call
  :func:`run_harbor_eval` loads the tasks, runs, and scores, so caller code is a
  couple of lines. ``harbor`` is imported lazily inside ``run_tasks`` (it is an
  optional extra), so importing this module never requires Harbor. Custom
  ``import_path`` agents are supported too: set ``agent_import_path`` and, for a
  loose ``harbor_wrapper.py``, also ``agent_dir`` — the runtime then injects that
  directory into ``sys.modules`` for the duration of the run and tears it down
  after (see :func:`scoped_harbor_agent_import`). When ``agent_dir`` is omitted
  (the module is already importable) the path is handed to Harbor's importer
  unchanged, so nothing is imposed on how the agent is packaged.
* **Injected / offline** — pass a ``job_dir`` (and optionally a ``run_job``
  callback) to adapt an already-completed job dir or to run a caller-built job.

Trial adaptation validates Harbor's on-disk ``result.json`` files with Harbor's
own model. The import remains lazy, but invoking native execution or offline
adaptation requires the optional Harbor extra and Python >=3.12.

    """Make ``agent_dir`` importable under a content-addressed package for the block.

    Args:
        agent_dir: directory containing the module referenced by ``import_path``.
        import_path: Harbor agent path, ``"module"`` or ``"module:attribute"``.
        exclude: resolved directories to leave out of the content digest. Pass the
            same set :func:`_cache_stamp` uses — in practice ``jobs_dir``, which is
            caller-chosen and may sit *under* ``agent_dir``. Omitting it lets the
            growing results tree feed the package name, so the import path would
            change on every run and the resume this function exists to enable would
            never happen. See :func:`_digest_directory`.

    Yields:
        str: the rewritten import path Harbor should load (the module rooted under
        the injected synthetic package, preserving any ``:attribute`` suffix).

    Raises:
        ValueError: if ``import_path`` has no module component.

    **The package name is derived from the directory's contents, not a random
    UUID, and that is load-bearing.** This string becomes ``AgentConfig.import_path``
    and therefore part of Harbor's ``JobConfig``, which Harbor compares field-by-field
    when deciding whether an existing job directory may be resumed. A random suffix
    made that comparison fail on every rerun, so Harbor raised ``FileExistsError``
    instead of resuming and its per-trial resume was unreachable for any caller that
    sets ``agent_dir`` (AALGO-430). Content-addressing keeps distinct agents isolated
    while letting an unchanged agent resume — and makes an *edited* agent invalidate
    the job dir on Harbor's own terms.

    Identical contents therefore share a package name, so overlapping scopes are
    refcounted: the injected ``sys.modules`` entries are removed when the last
    scope exits, not the first (see :func:`_uninstall_agent_package`). The mutation
    is guarded by a process-wide lock. ``sys.modules`` is per-process, so concurrent
    *processes* were never at risk here.

    The name is ``<dirname>_<digest>``, so it tracks the directory's *location* as
    well as its contents — deliberately, because an opaque hash makes every traceback
    and import error unreadable. That is a narrow, knowing divergence from the cache
    stamp, which excludes ``agent_dir`` so a relocated but identical agent still hits
    (see :func:`_cache_stamp`). Relocating an agent while pinning the same
    ``job_name`` therefore leaves the stamp valid but changes this string, and Harbor
    declines to resume; :func:`_build_native_job` absorbs that into a clean re-run.
    The results stay correct — it costs one repeated job. Callers that rebuild agents
    under changing directory names (the Experimentalist does) are unaffected, because
    the agent name feeds their ``job_name`` too, so a rename lands in a different job
    dir with nothing to resume.

    **That last sentence only holds if the caller derives its job name from the
    *resolved* directory, as this function does.** Deriving it from the caller's
    spelling instead lets the two disagree: a symlink keeps its own name while
    resolving elsewhere, so flipping it at a fixed ``job_name`` would reuse one job
    dir for two different agents, caught only by Harbor's refusal rather than by
    design. The Experimentalist resolves first for exactly this reason
    (``resolve_harbor_run_inputs``).

    Only ``agent_dir`` (not ``sys.path``) is made importable, so a loose wrapper
    must be self-contained: a single module, or one that reaches siblings via
    relative imports (``from .helper import ...``). A wrapper that does an absolute
    ``import helper`` of a sibling file won't resolve — install it as a package and
    use the ``agent_dir``-less path instead.
