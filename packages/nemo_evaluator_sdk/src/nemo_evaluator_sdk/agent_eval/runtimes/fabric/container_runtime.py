"""Containerized NeMo Fabric agent-eval runtime.

``FabricContainerRuntime`` is the sandboxed sibling of
:class:`~nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.runtimes.fabric.runtime.FabricAgentRuntime`: instead of
running the Fabric harness on the host filesystem, it runs it **inside a sandbox** (Docker now,
Kubernetes/agent-sandbox later) through the provider-neutral
:class:`~nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.runtimes.sandbox.api.AsyncSandbox` seam.

Per task it:

1. seeds ``/in`` with the Fabric agent config, profiles, and framed input, plus the task's workspace
   seed files;
2. execs Fabric's own CLI (``fabric run``), which writes a normalized ``RunResult`` to stdout and the
   workspace + Relay ATIF trajectory under a fixed ``/out`` layout;
3. downloads ``/out`` across the boundary into the durable per-task evidence dir; and
4. maps it into the shared :class:`CandidateEvidence` contract the eval metrics consume — ``result``
   (json), ``trace`` (ATIF), plus ``workspace`` (filesystem) and ``logs`` — so the workspace-file,
   held-out ``run_verifier``, and trajectory metrics score container trials with no metric changes.
   (``FabricAgentRuntime`` surfaces ``workspace``/``logs`` only when Fabric promotes them as artifacts;
   the container always captures them from the ``/out`` tree, so its evidence is a superset.)

Relay writes ATIF **inside the image** (no host gateway), which removes the bare-``python3`` /
``tomli_w`` adapter-interpreter problem the host runtime has to work around.
