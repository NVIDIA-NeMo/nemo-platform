"""Read and display the results of an agent-eval run.

Companion to ``run_gym_eval.py``: that script *produces* a run bundle, this one *reads* it and shows
how to get at each kind of result — headline aggregates, ``pass@k``, per-task outcomes, and the
runner's own aggregations.

Per-task results are read through the SDK's own typed view, ``summary.task_outcomes(metric_name)``,
rather than by walking the nested ``summary.task_metric_values`` dict here — that is the accessor to
lift into your own code. Everything shown here also works on the in-memory ``AgentEvalResult``
returned by ``AgentEvaluator().run(...)`` — reading from a bundle just makes the example runnable
without a live run.

There is no bundle checked into the repo — ``run_gym_eval.py`` makes one. It writes to a fresh
temporary directory by default, so give it an explicit ``--output-dir`` and point this script at the
same path. From the repository root::

    uv run python -m packages.nemo_evaluator_sdk.examples.gym.run_gym_eval \\
        --output-dir /tmp/gym-eval
    uv run python -m packages.nemo_evaluator_sdk.examples.gym.inspect_results --bundle /tmp/gym-eval

Any agent-eval bundle works, not just a Gym one: pass ``--metric-type``/``--output-name`` for the
metric it was scored with. Only the ``runner.gym.`` section is Gym-specific, and it is skipped when a
run has no imported aggregations.
