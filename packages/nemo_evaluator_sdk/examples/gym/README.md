# Run a NeMo Gym environment through NeMo Evaluator

`run_gym_eval.py` runs an **existing** NeMo Gym environment (the `mcqa` benchmark by default) through the Evaluator's `GymAgentTaskRunner` and scores it with `AgentEvaluator`. Use it when you already have a Gym environment and want to run and score it through NeMo Evaluator without migrating it. Gym owns execution *and* scoring; the runner shells out to the `gym` CLI and adapts the rollout bundle into trials, and `GymRewardMetric` surfaces Gym's per-attempt reward.

Mapping: one Gym dataset → one run; each distinct row → one `AgentEvalTask` (id = content hash of the row); each attempt (`--num-repeats`) → one `AgentEvalTrial`. So `--num-repeats 2` over a 5-row dataset yields 5 tasks × 2 = 10 trials.

## Prerequisites

**1. NeMo Gym installed in the same environment as the SDK**, plus the target environment's own dependencies. Environments ship in the `nemo-gym` wheel — `resources_servers` and friends install beside `nemo_gym`, configs and `data/example.jsonl` included — so no checkout is needed:

```bash
pip install nemo-gym
pip install tiktoken        # mcqa's own dependency; each resources_server ships a requirements.txt
```

The runner shells out to whatever `gym` is on PATH. There is deliberately no setting for a checkout, another venv, or a search root: this config becomes a serialized job spec when Gym runs as a platform job, and a local path means nothing on the other side of that boundary.

**2. Model credentials for the collector** — a gitignored `env.yaml` in the directory you run from:

```bash
cat > env.yaml <<'YAML'
policy_base_url: https://<your-openai-compatible-endpoint>/v1
policy_api_key: <key>
policy_model_name: <model, e.g. nvidia/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct>
YAML
```

> Gym searches the working directory, then its install root. This SDK never reads that file — the `gym` subprocess does.

## Run

From the directory holding `env.yaml`:

```bash
uv run python -m packages.nemo_evaluator_sdk.examples.gym.run_gym_eval
```

Working from a Gym checkout also makes its components take precedence over the packaged ones, which is how you reach an environment whose data the wheel does not carry (bulk train/validation splits are not git-tracked, so they are not in it).

Useful flags: `--resources-server`, `--agent`, `--model-type` (`inference_provider` for OpenAI-compatible **chat** endpoints; `openai_model` uses the OpenAI **Responses API** and 500s against chat-only endpoints), `--num-repeats`, `--dataset`, `--output-dir`.

For the full set of knobs the underlying `gym env start` / `gym eval run` commands accept, see the [NeMo Gym documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym). Anything `GymRuntimeConfig` does not expose as a field can be passed through with its `env_overrides` escape hatch (Hydra `+key=value` overrides applied to `gym env start`).

Each run writes its bundle to a fresh temporary directory by default. Pass `--output-dir` to choose one, but give every run its own: the runner refuses to reuse a directory that already holds Gym rollout output (Gym appends to its failures sidecar, so reusing one would mix runs) and raises rather than clearing a prior run's results.

Expected output:

```text
discovered 5 tasks from .../resources_servers/mcqa/data/example.jsonl
=== RESULT ===
tasks: 5  trials: 10
aggregate scores:
  gym_reward.reward: mean=0.6

Run bundle (run.json, trials.jsonl, scores.jsonl, report.html): /var/folders/.../gym-eval-ab12cd34
```

## Read the results

`inspect_results.py` reads `summary.json` and shows each result layer: run aggregates from
`summary.scores`, ordered per-task attempt values from `summary.task_metric_values`, and runner-owned
aggregates under `runner.gym.*`. Per-task keys use `<metric_type>.<output>`; a `null` attempt is a trial
that failed before scoring, while an empty list means the metric produced no usable measurement.

No bundle is checked in; the run above produces one. Give it a stable `--output-dir` and point the reader at the same path:

```bash
uv run python -m packages.nemo_evaluator_sdk.examples.gym.run_gym_eval \
    --output-dir /tmp/gym-eval
uv run python -m packages.nemo_evaluator_sdk.examples.gym.inspect_results --bundle /tmp/gym-eval
```

Aggregates named `runner.gym.*` are Gym's own figures, imported into `summary.scores` so they are addressable exactly like the SDK's — the prefix is what tells you which side computed them. The script cross-checks Gym's `pass@1` against the SDK's natively-computed one (Gym reports accuracy on a 0-100 scale where the SDK uses 0-1). It works on any agent-eval bundle: pass `--metric-type`/`--output-name` for a run scored with a different metric.

## How it runs Gym

The runner uses Gym's **two-step** flow, which reads a dataset file directly (no split-driven data-prep, no HuggingFace downloads):

1. `gym env start …` — brings up the resources-server + agent + model servers.
2. `gym eval run --no-serve --input <dataset> …` — collects rollouts against them.

It does **not** import `nemo_gym` and does **not** handle secrets — it invokes whichever `gym` executable is on `PATH`, resolved once to an absolute path so the subprocesses cannot pick up a different one, and Gym reads credentials from the `env.yaml` in the directory you run from.

The dataset handed to step 2 is not your source file. The runner **materializes** a normalized one into the run's work directory: one row per requested task, with `_ng_task_index` stamped explicitly. Gym honors a caller-supplied `_ng_task_index` (it only assigns one when a row lacks it) and echoes it back on every rollout record, so rollouts join back to tasks through a map the runner owns rather than a guess about Gym's internal row ordering. It also means running a *subset* of tasks only rolls out that subset.

### Logs

Gym's subprocess output is streamed to files in the run's work directory — `gym_env.log` for `gym env start`, and `gym_eval.stdout.log` / `gym_eval.stderr.log` for the collection — and mirrored to the `nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.runtimes.gym_runtime` logger at `DEBUG`. Startup and collection failures name the relevant files and inline the last lines. To watch Gym's output in your own terminal, turn that logger up:

```python
logging.getLogger("nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.runtimes.gym_runtime").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Notes & caveats

- **One distinct row is one task.** Task identity is the row's content hash, so duplicate rows collapse into a single task and the runner warns. Repeating a row is *not* how you ask for repeated attempts — `num_repeats` is, since attempts are a run-level concern. Duplicates usually mean a data problem.
- **Per-env deps are heterogeneous.** mcqa needs only `tiktoken`; other Gym envs pull `torch`/COMET/GPU or docker. The caller is responsible for a Gym runtime whose deps are installed.
- **`--no-serve --input` bypasses Gym's data-prep** (prompt templating / dataset materialization). This example's `example.jsonl` rows are already complete, so it's faithful; an env whose rows need templating would need that step first.
- Service-side execution (docker/k8s, Ray provisioning) is out of scope for this SDK path — that's the evaluator plugin's job.
