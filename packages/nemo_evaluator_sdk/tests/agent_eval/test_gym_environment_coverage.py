"""Coverage of the Gym runner across a representative sample of Gym environments.

The other Gym tests (``test_gym_runtime.py``, ``test_gym_aggregate_scores.py``) replay recorded
fixtures through the adapter and never invoke the CLI, so they encode whatever ``mcqa`` happens to do
and keep passing for every other environment. This module goes the other way: it drives the real
``gym`` CLI against several environments chosen to span Gym's dependency and wiring categories.

Gym ships 105 ``resources_servers`` — 68 with two or fewer dependencies, 28 with multi-dependency CPU
stacks, 6 heavy/GPU, and 10 requiring Docker — and ``mcqa`` is the easiest of all of them, so "the
runner works" has only ever been established for the least demanding case.

**Two layers, deliberately.** ``gym env validate`` merges configs, flags, and overrides and reports
unset ``???`` values, bad paths, and dangling cross-references *without Ray, servers, a model
endpoint, or credentials*. It is fast, offline, and answers most of what this sweep wants to know, so
every environment gets a validate test. The rollout tests then start the servers and collect for
real, against a built-in stub endpoint (:class:`_StubPolicyServer`) so they need no model of their
own; set ``NEMO_GYM_POLICY_BASE_URL`` to run them against a real one instead.

That split matters because model wiring is not standardized. ``mcqa``/``gpqa_diamond``/
``wmt_translation`` reference a ``policy_model`` server fed by the global ``policy_base_url`` /
``policy_api_key`` / ``policy_model_name`` keys; ``gdpval`` wants a judge server named
``gdpval_judge_model`` that no shipped config defines; ``legal_agent_bench`` takes a raw
``judge_base_url``; and ``wmt_translation`` also loads a local COMET model that is not an endpoint at
all. Validate surfaces those differences as concrete errors instead of as a startup timeout.

Prerequisites, in the order the skips report them:

* **NeMo Gym installed in this environment** (``pip install nemo-gym``). Environments ship in the
  wheel, so no checkout is required.
* **The target environment's own dependencies** — each ``resources_server`` ships a
  ``requirements.txt``; install it from that directory so its ``-e nemo-gym[dev] @ ../../`` resolves.
* **Docker**, for environments whose agent works inside containers.

A model endpoint is *not* a prerequisite: the stub supplies one. ``NEMO_GYM_POLICY_BASE_URL`` is an
override for running against a real model, not a gate.

Tracked by AALGO-485; the CI and GPU-runner story is AALGO-494.

    """An OpenAI-compatible ``/v1/chat/completions`` endpoint that answers from a prompt-keyed map.

    **Why a stub at all.** Collecting rollouts needs a reachable model, and requiring one turned the
    whole rollout half of this module into a permanent skip — the runner's `validate -> env start ->
    eval run` sequence had never executed end to end. A stub removes the only prerequisite these
    tests could not satisfy for themselves.

    **Why prompt-keyed rather than a canned reply.** The oracle answers each prompt with *that row's*
    own expected answer, so a passing run means every task received the answer belonging to it. Gym
    attributes rollouts back to tasks through an index this runner assigns, and an off-by-one there
    would still produce a full set of trials — just with the answers paired to the wrong tasks. Under
    a canned reply that bug scores identically to a correct run; under the oracle every reward drops
    to 0. A queue-based mock cannot express this either, since rollouts are collected concurrently
    and arrival order is not the dataset order.

    Stdlib rather than ``pytest-httpserver``: Gym reaches this endpoint from *subprocesses*, so it
    has to be a real socket, and `packages/nemo_evaluator_sdk` does not depend on `nmp-testing`.
    ``plugins/nemo-guardrails/tests/unit/benchmarks/test_shim.py`` sets the same precedent.
