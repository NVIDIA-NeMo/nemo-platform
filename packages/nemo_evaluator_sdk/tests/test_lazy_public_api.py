"""Guards the lazy (PEP 562) public surfaces of the evaluator SDK.

Two barrels re-export lazily, and importing any submodule runs both in turn, so a single
convenience ``from … import …`` added at either module scope silently re-drags the whole
backend/benchmark/metric stack into every consumer that only wanted ``agent_eval``:

* ``nemo_evaluator_sdk/__init__.py`` (AALGO-429) — the execution/backend and metric stack.
* ``nemo_evaluator_sdk/values/__init__.py`` (AALGO-311) — pyarrow, numpy, jinja2 and jsonschema,
  together with the deferred pyarrow import in ``values/results.py``.

Both are covered here in their source form and in the ``nemo_platform.beta.evaluator`` mirror the
vendoring tool generates.

Every *assertion* runs out-of-process. Resolving a whole public surface imports openai, sacrebleu,
ragas and the execution stack; doing that in-process would leave them in ``sys.modules`` for every
test that runs after it in the session, so a future in-process "module X must not be imported"
check — the natural way someone would extend this file — would depend on collection order. The one
in-process call is the ``find_spec`` availability probe below, which is deliberately restricted to
a top-level name so that it imports nothing.
