"""Helpers for bridging sync and async NeMo Platform SDK entry points.

``sync_to_async_sdk`` exists because Data Designer validation and provider
resolution are async-first: they call platform services to validate filesets,
secrets, personas, and model providers before handing work to the upstream
Data Designer engine, and in the case of preview this work happens within the
FastAPI process with an injected ``AsyncNeMoPlatform``. However, some legitimate
callers still start with a sync ``NeMoPlatform`` instance, notably sync SDK/CLI
validation and job-container runtime code, so those paths need an async sibling
that preserves the same base URL, workspace, headers, query defaults, timeout,
and retry settings.
