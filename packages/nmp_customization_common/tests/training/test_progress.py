"""Unit tests for JobsServiceProgressReporter's status_details handling.

The Jobs service merges ``status_details`` key-wise rather than replacing the
blob (``JobDispatcher._update_status_details_object``, verified end-to-end
against a running platform), so a report only ever has to state what it
observed. These tests pin that: each report sends its own fields and nothing
else, and the only read the reporter makes is the one-shot resume seeding.
