"""Unit tests for the shared TrainingProgressCallback.

Focused on the contract every backend depends on. There is one naming rule --
a metric is stored and reported as ``<phase>_<name>`` -- and no metric is
privileged, so most of this file is about proving the rule holds with no
exceptions hiding in it. The rest covers the transport: the Jobs service merges
``status_details`` key-wise but shallowly, so a report either resends a series in
full or leaves the key out, and states a scalar only when it observed one.
