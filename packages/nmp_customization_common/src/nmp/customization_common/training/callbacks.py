"""Training progress callback shared by the customization backends.

Wraps a :class:`~nmp.customization_common.training.progress.JobsServiceProgressReporter`
and turns a backend's metric dict into job status. Every chartable metric is
reported as a current value; the ones matching ``time_series_metrics`` also
accumulate a history under a ``metrics`` key.

Naming
------
One rule, no exceptions: a metric is stored and reported as ``<phase>_<name>``,
the backend supplying its framework's ``<name>`` (``loss``, ``lr``, ``accuracy``)
and the phase supplying the prefix. ``train_loss`` and ``val_loss`` are what that
produces for ``loss``, not special cases.

The prefix is load-bearing. DPO reports ``accuracy`` on both train and
validation, so bare names would interleave two different quantities into one
series. It also keeps metrics clear of the keys this class owns -- ``phase``,
``step``, ``epoch``, ``metrics``.

What a report costs
-------------------
The Jobs service merges ``status_details`` key-wise but shallowly: a key that is
sent replaces the stored value wholesale, and one left out is left standing. So a
report either resends a series in full or omits the key entirely.

One report is three writes -- client, task, job attempt -- and the two
server-side ones PUT the whole entity blob whether or not the report mentioned
the series. Measured at ~43 bytes a point and 46ms + 0.31ms/KB a report, and that
latency lands on the training thread between optimizer steps.

This class does not thin or cap what it records, deliberately. The quadratic is a
property of ``status_details`` being a blob that is replaced wholesale, and
capping points here only made that cheaper to leave unfixed; a point cap was
tried and removed. The limiter below bounds how *often* a report goes, not how
much it carries, and nothing here bounds a long run -- that ceiling belongs to
the transport. See the AALGO-497 design note for the measurements and the
argument.

Seeding
-------
The accumulator lives in this process, so it seeds itself from the server.
Without that, a process taking over a task would report from empty and -- the
merge being wholesale per key -- erase the curves already stored.

Known issue, left alone deliberately: when a pod is replaced mid-task the new
process seeds from the old one's points and appends its own, so one series can
carry two runs. Consumers see the last value written at a given step plus a tail
from the abandoned attempt. Fixing it means telling two restart shapes apart --
a from-scratch restart, whose earlier points are a real history worth keeping,
and a resume-from-checkpoint, whose replayed range is work that was rolled back
-- which is more than a passing change.

Backends subclass this and set :attr:`_default_backend`; callers may also pass
``backend`` per call.

        literal step 0 would overwrite the stored ``percentage_done`` -- the
