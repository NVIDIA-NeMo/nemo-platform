"""How much detail training progress is reported with.

One fragment, embedded in every backend's schedule section under one field name,
so the docs, the SDK and Studio can treat the knob uniformly rather than learning
three spellings of it. Deliberately *not* a
:class:`~nmp.customization_common.schema.NamespacedModel`: that base exists to
keep two backends' same-named-but-different models from colliding in the merged
``/apis/customization`` spec, and this is the opposite case -- one model, shared
on purpose, which should emit one component.

Kept in its own module rather than beside the callback that consumes it so the
API layer can import the schema without pulling in the platform SDK that
:mod:`nmp.customization_common.training.progress` needs.
