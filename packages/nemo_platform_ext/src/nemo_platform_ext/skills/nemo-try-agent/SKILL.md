# NeMo Platform try-agent

Invoke an existing NeMo agent through a deployment or directly from a local YAML config. Announce the target before sending. Never invoke silently.

## Pre-flight

Choose the invocation mode from the user's target:

- **Local one-shot:** the user provides an `agent.yaml` or legacy NAT workflow
  YAML path. Read the config format and model settings before deciding whether
  Platform readiness is required:
  - A Platform-managed `nemo-agents-spec-v1` config invokes Fabric directly and
    does not require Platform readiness.
  - A legacy NAT config requires Platform readiness when any `openai` or `nim`
    LLM omits `base_url`; local invocation injects the Platform IGW URL for
    those entries.
  - A legacy NAT config whose applicable LLMs all provide explicit `base_url`
    values may invoke those endpoints directly without Platform readiness.
- **Deployed agent:** the user names a deployment or asks to use an already
  deployed agent. Preserve the active CLI context and confirm the target
  Platform is reachable by listing deployments:

```bash
.venv/bin/nemo agents deployments list 2>/dev/null || { echo "PLATFORM_UNREACHABLE"; exit 1; }
```

When the user explicitly selects a local Platform, override any remote CLI
context for the current shell and add local process and health checks before
listing deployments:

```bash
export NMP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
lsof -iTCP:8080 -sTCP:LISTEN >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "PLATFORM_DOWN"; exit 1; }
curl -sS --connect-timeout 2 --max-time 5 "$NMP_BASE_URL/health/ready" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "^200$" || { echo "PLATFORM_WEDGED"; exit 1; }
.venv/bin/nemo agents deployments list 2>/dev/null
```

Do not use `nemo services status` for the local process check; it can report
stale "running" state from held locks after the process has died.

Require these checks for a deployed invocation and for a local NAT invocation
that depends on injected Platform IGW routing. If `PLATFORM_UNREACHABLE` or
`PLATFORM_DOWN`, route to `nemo-setup` and stop. If `PLATFORM_WEDGED`, route to
`nemo-status` and stop. Do not require the checks for Platform-managed Fabric
local invocation or a NAT config with directly usable explicit endpoints.

## What you do

1. **Find the target.**
   - Local YAML path supplied: set `INVOCATION_MODE=local` and
     `AGENT_CONFIG_PATH` to that config.
   - Deployment named: confirm it is `running`, set
     `INVOCATION_MODE=deployed`, and set `DEPLOYMENT_NAME` to its name.
   - One running deployment and no target named: use it and set the deployed
     mode variables above.
   - Multiple running deployments: list their names, ask the user which one,
     then set the deployed mode variables above.
   - No running deployments: report that no deployed agent is available. Do not silently replace an agent invocation with `nemo chat`.

2. **Announce.** Say one of:
   - "Invoking local agent config `<path>`."
   - "Sending to deployment `<name>`."
   - "Multiple deployments are running; which one: <name1>, <name2>?" Then wait.

3. **Send the query.**

```bash
if [ "$INVOCATION_MODE" = "local" ]; then
  RESP=$(.venv/bin/nemo agents invoke \
    --agent-config "$AGENT_CONFIG_PATH" \
    --input "$USER_QUERY")
else
  RESP=$(.venv/bin/nemo agents invoke \
    --agent-deployment "$DEPLOYMENT_NAME" \
    --input "$USER_QUERY")
fi
RC=$?
```

1. **Show the verbatim response.** Print `RESP` in a code block without
   paraphrasing it. If the agent used tool calls, list which tools and their
   outputs before the final answer.

2. **Offer another invocation.** Keep the same target unless the user changes it. Do not claim that separate CLI invocations preserve a conversation session.

## Verification

A "successful" invocation requires both: (a) the CLI returns exit code 0, and (b) the response body is non-empty. An empty body on a question the spec says the agent should handle is a quality signal, not a success.

```bash
if [ $RC -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "INVOKE_FAILED (exit $RC)"
elif [ -z "$RESP" ]; then
  echo "EMPTY_RESPONSE"
else
  echo "OK"
fi
```

Do not switch targets for verification.

If `INVOKE_FAILED` or `EMPTY_RESPONSE`: surface that to the user and stop. Do not claim the invocation succeeded.

## If verification fails

| Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| 404 "deployment not found" | Deployment was removed or the wrong name was used | Re-run `.venv/bin/nemo agents deployments list`; ask the user to pick from the new list |
| Deployment is not `running` | Deployment is still starting or failed | Inspect it with `.venv/bin/nemo agents deployments get <name>`; do not invoke until it is running |
| Config validation error | Local YAML is invalid or references missing artifacts | Surface the validation details; route local YAML fixes or migrations to `nemo-agent-config`; use `nemo-build-agent` only when the user explicitly requests redeployment |
| Adapter or runtime error | Required harness package or runtime dependency is unavailable | Surface the structured invocation error and required dependency; do not substitute model chat |
| 5xx or platform error | Platform or deployed runtime is unhealthy | Route to `nemo-status` to surface the underlying error |
| Empty response on a spec-handled question | Quality issue, not invocation issue | Stop and report; do not loop until the user decides next step |
| "I cannot help" on every question | System prompt or tool wiring wrong in YAML | Route to `nemo-build-agent` to inspect and redeploy |
| `agents plugin unavailable` | Plugin not installed | Route to `nemo-setup` Step 3 |

## Gotchas

- **Routing must be explicit.** Silently picking a target and sending a query is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent. Announce first.
- **Use an explicit deployment name.** `--agent-deployment` avoids ambiguity when one Agent entity has multiple deployments.
- **Keep agent and model chat distinct.** Offer `nemo chat` only when the user explicitly chooses a raw model query.
- **Use `curl` only for the pre-flight health probe.** The CLI is the documented interface for agent operations. Hand-rolled HTTP is not a substitute.
- **Do not promise session continuity.** Reusing a deployment target is not the same as resuming a specific multi-turn session.
