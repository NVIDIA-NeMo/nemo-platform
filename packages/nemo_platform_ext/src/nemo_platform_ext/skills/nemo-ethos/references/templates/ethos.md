## Role

<one concrete sentence describing the role this agent plays for its users; this
is the fast, human-readable one-liner another agent should remember>

## Purpose & Outcomes

<the mission and the result it is judged by, in that order. Keeping them in one
section is deliberate: a purpose with no outcome cannot be optimized, and an
outcome with no purpose gets optimized in the wrong direction.

**Mission.** One or two short paragraphs: why the agent exists, what user value
it provides, which product or workflow it belongs to, and the decision or
business context it supports. Use context from outside the codebase when the
user provides it, and say so plainly when this is inferred from code alone.

**Outcome.** The external result the agent is accountable for, stated so someone
outside the team could tell whether it worked. Give the measurable target where
one exists and who owns that number. This is what the agent earns its keep by
improving, and what a downstream optimizer weighs against cost and latency.

Example: "Ships inside the Acme onboarding flow to get a new developer from
signup to a working API call without human help. Success is cutting median
time-to-first-successful-request from 40 minutes to under 15, without raising
support ticket volume. Owner: growth team."

When the agent is internal tooling with no business metric, say that outright
rather than inventing one.>

## Scope

- Audience: <who talks to it — internal employees, external customers, developers, etc.>
- Categories: <3-6 task buckets, separated by semicolons; e.g. VPN; password reset; software access>
- In scope: <capabilities, user intents, or situations the agent is expected to handle; semicolon-separated or `_(none)_`>
- Out of scope: <capabilities, user intents, or situations the agent should not handle; semicolon-separated or `_(none)_`>

## Tools

<tools, APIs, and knowledge sources the agent can use, or the literal string
`Prompt-only.` if none. Group related helpers by capability or source instead
of listing every low-level method. Capture only behaviorally important purpose,
credentials or scopes, side effects, data freshness, expected failures, and
anything a downstream optimizer should know when deciding whether a trace shows
bad agent behavior or a normal tool/source limitation.>

| Tool or source | Purpose | Credentials/scopes | Side effects | Freshness / expected failures |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| current_datetime | clock for time-sensitive answers | none | none | current at call time |

## Harness

<how this agent actually runs. Describe the loop, how it calls tools, and where
it executes. Write what is true of this agent. Do not pick a name from a
platform catalog, and do not treat a framework import as a requirement.

Useful things to cover when they apply:

- How model turns, tool calls, and stop conditions are orchestrated
- How tools are chosen, executed, and returned
- How context, memory, and session state are kept
- Safety, sandbox, or permission controls around actions
- How you observe and verify a run
- The runtime, such as a service, CLI, notebook, hosted agent, or workflow

Write `_(none)_` if you cannot describe how this agent runs.>

## Behavior

<behavioral rules and boundaries: constraints, refusal and escalation policy,
tone, safety/compliance requirements, accepted limitations, and known non-goals.
Use this to tell downstream optimization agents what counts as divergence and
what should not be filed as a failure.>

## Principles

<how this agent should decide when no rule in `Behavior` covers the case. Rules
run out; this section is what a downstream agent falls back on.

Write the judgment calls, not the personality. "Prefer saying I don't know over
a confident guess, because a wrong answer here costs a user their afternoon" is
usable. "Helpful, harmless, and honest" is not — it is true of every agent and
tells a reader nothing.

Two or three of these is plenty. Good candidates:

- Which way to err when the request is ambiguous: ask, assume, or refuse.
- What the agent protects even when it makes the answer worse — a source
  citation, an audit trail, an explicit uncertainty flag.
- Whose interest wins when the user's request and the business goal disagree.

Keep concrete rules in `Behavior` and metric weighting in `Trade-offs`. This
section is only for judgment where neither applies. Write `_(none)_` if there
is no judgment call beyond those two.>

## Success Criteria

<what good production behavior looks like for this agent, independent of the
current eval suite. Lead with mission-level outcomes and user goals, then
capture quality standards, escalation quality, accuracy expectations, and
representative examples of successful behavior. Rank them if some matter more
than others.

Keep this section about quality and outcomes. Latency and cost belong
elsewhere: a production ceiling is a `Constraints` entry, and how to weigh speed
against quality is a `Trade-offs` entry.>

## Trade-offs

<how to choose when two candidate improvements pull in different directions.
Measurements alone never say which candidate is better; this section does.

State three things:

1. **Hard gates.** Qualities that are never traded away, at any gain elsewhere.
   Correctness and safety usually live here.
2. **Priority order.** Rank the remaining goals — task quality, latency, cost,
   reliability, coverage — so a candidate that improves one and regresses
   another can be judged.
3. **Unacceptable regressions.** Anything that must not get worse even when the
   headline metric improves, and by how much it may move if some slack is fine.

Example: "Answer correctness is a hard gate; never trade it. Then, in order:
p95 latency under 10s, cost per session, then token efficiency. A 5% cost
increase is acceptable for a 2-point correctness gain. Escalation accuracy must
never regress; it is how users trust the agent."

Keep this at the level of intent. The optimizer turns it into thresholds and
weights; do not try to write the scoring function here.>

## Constraints

<hard external bounds on the solution space that no optimization may cross,
regardless of measured benefit. These are usually organizational rather than
technical, which is exactly why no coding agent can infer them.

Cover whichever apply:

- **Approved providers and models:** which vendors, endpoints, regions, and
  model families are permitted, and which are forbidden even if they benchmark
  better. Name the deployment mode where it is fixed, such as local NIM only.
  State the permitted set rather than the model in use today, which the agent
  config already carries and which changes without touching this file.
- **Data handling:** residency, retention, redaction, and what may not leave a
  boundary or enter a prompt.
- **Compliance and policy:** regimes the agent operates under and the audit or
  disclosure obligations that follow.
- **Production ceilings:** maximum cost per run or session and latency SLOs the
  deployed agent must respect. Where you know the current measured figure, give
  it alongside the ceiling — "p95 is 4.1s today against a 6s SLO" tells an
  optimizer how much headroom it has, where the ceiling alone does not. Write
  `_(unmeasured)_` rather than guessing.
- **Required approvals:** changes that need a human sign-off before shipping,
  and who signs.

Example: "Models must come from the internal inference gateway; no direct
third-party API calls. Customer data must not leave the EU. Cost must stay under
$0.08 per session. Any new tool with write access needs security review."

Write `_(none)_` only if you are genuinely unconstrained.>

## Evaluation Setup

<the current validation setup. Include how to run it, what datasets or checks it
uses, what scorers or metrics measure, pass/fail thresholds, and known coverage
gaps relative to the success criteria. If no eval suite is wired yet, say that
explicitly and describe any partial/manual validation that exists.>

## Metric Semantics

<what your metric and telemetry field names actually mean, and the claims they
do not support. A downstream agent that guesses a field's meaning from its name
will produce confident, wrong findings.

Use a row per field that is ambiguous, easy to misread, or load-bearing in a
decision. Skip the obvious ones. A known-broken or known-noisy field belongs
here too: saying what it cannot support is the cheapest way to stop an analyst
re-reporting the same non-issue.>

| Field or signal | Meaning | How consumers may use it |
|---|---|---|
| <e.g. `score`> | <what the number actually measures, and its source> | <the claim it supports, and the claim it does not> |

Use `_(none)_` if every metric name means exactly what it says.

## Change Scope

- <part of the agent>: <yes | no | with-approval>
- Notes: <vetoes, exceptions, or other scope clarifications; use `_(none)_` if there are none>

Use `with-approval` when a change is permitted but must not ship unattended.
Name the approver in `Constraints` or `Notes`.

## Vision

<where this agent is headed, so a change that fits the direction is not judged
only against today's scope.

**Intention.** <what the agent is ultimately for, beyond the job it does today.
One or two sentences.>

**Target use cases.** <one or two concrete scenarios the agent should grow into
but does not serve yet. These are the cases `Scope` calls out of scope *for
now*, which is different from out of scope on principle — the distinction stops
a change from hardcoding around a direction you already know is coming.>

- <future use case>

Keep this durable. A dated backlog belongs in your tracker, because a roadmap
that goes stale makes the whole file less trusted. Write `_(none)_` rather than
filling this with next quarter's tickets.>

## Open Questions

- <unresolved fact that affects safe use, evaluation, or modification of the agent; remove once answered>
