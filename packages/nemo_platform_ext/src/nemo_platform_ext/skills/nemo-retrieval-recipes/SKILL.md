# NeMo Platform retrieval recipes

Conduct the Nemotron embed/rerank pipeline **on NeMo Platform plugin CLIs**. Do not
run `uv run nemotron embed|rerank`. Do not use `nemo data-designer create`.

Plugin skills (`nemo-data-designer-plugin`, `nemo-customizer`, `nemo-evaluator-plugin`)
are stage manuals. This skill owns family routing, artifact IDs, frozen eval, and
the 15% nDCG@10 / Recall@10 README bar.

## Resolve CLI

Use `nemo`, or `uv run nemo` from the nemo-platform root. If neither works, route
to `setup`. The CLI defaults to `http://localhost:8080`; `NMP_BASE_URL` overrides
it for a remote platform. Confirm `/health/ready` on the resolved base URL before
submitting jobs, and recheck it before rereading a command that returned empty or
non-JSON output — that is an unreachable platform, not a missing entity.

## Choose a family

Read only the matching recipe after this routing step:

- Low Recall@k, missing relevant documents, first-stage retrieval → `references/embed.md`
- Recall@100 OK but nDCG@10 poor, relevant docs buried in top-k → `references/rerank.md`
- User asks both or a two-stage stack → embed first (candidate coverage), then rerank.

Use one workspace. Stage 1 publishes one `artifacts` fileset holding `training.jsonl`
and `eval_beir/`; Automodel and `retrieve-eval` both read that one fileset directly.
Keep `query:` / `passage:` prefixes for embed and
`question:{query} \n \n passage:{passage}` for rerank.

## Safe workflow

1. Confirm corpus governance: Stage 0 sends chunk text to Inference Gateway chat
   models. Do not ask users to paste API keys. Use `provider` / `chat_provider` /
   `embed_provider`, not `NVIDIA_API_KEY` on the job.
2. Dry-run schemas first: `nemo data-designer retrieval-generate --help`,
   `nemo customization automodel explain`, `nemo evaluator retrieve-eval explain`.
3. Live SDG is the default for a user corpus; drive it through Stage 0 generation
   knobs (see `references/sdg.md`). It needs **50+ documents**, since one file can
   dump every query into the test split and leave train empty (mining then crashes).
   Reach for a published Stage 0 dump only when the user has no corpus or wants a
   fast first eval.
4. Run Stage 0+1 once (`retrieval-run`, or generate then prepare). **Freeze** the
   resulting `eval_beir`; never regenerate it for base vs tuned comparisons.
5. Confirm the training model entity has a non-null `fileset`. Auto-discovered
   Inference Gateway model entities are endpoints, not trainable checkpoints.
6. Fine-tune with explicit `training.recipe: bi_encoder` or `cross_encoder` and
   `finetuning_type` `all_weights` or `lora_merged` only.
7. Default stop after `retrieve-eval` with `baseline` + tuned target, `k: [1,5,10,100]`.
8. Deploy is opt-in. Automodel writes ONNX at the fileset root (`alternates/hf/`
   for the HF checkpoint) for both `bi_encoder` and `cross_encoder`. Embed: Retriever
   NIM 2.2.0. Rerank: Ranking NIM `llama-nemotron-rerank-1b-v2:1.10.0`. Do not shell
   out to `nemotron embed|rerank export`.
9. Poll jobs at 60–300s. Parse JSON from **stdout only** (never `2>&1` into `json.load`).

Report absolute and relative nDCG@10, Recall@10, and Recall@100 on the same frozen
eval set. Prefer at least 100 queries; warn below 50. Treat 15% relative nDCG@10
and Recall@10 uplift as an indicative embed target, not a hard small-corpus gate.

For stage-specific failures, hand off to `nemo-data-designer-plugin`,
`nemo-customizer`, `nemo-evaluator-plugin`, or `inference`.
