"""Episode provisioning broker contract, shared by NeMo-Gym and NeMo-RL.

Vendored from NeMo-Gym rather than imported. The definitions live on an unmerged branch
(``soluwalana/Gym@nmp/customizer``, commit ``f2a47392``), which is 180 commits behind upstream and
carries no release — so depending on them would pin the platform to a personal fork. Upstream
``NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym`` has no ``sandbox.broker`` module at all.

This is a *contract*, not an implementation: request/response models, path and header constants, and
validators. ``BROKER_PROTOCOL_VERSION`` is what detects drift between the two copies — bump it there
and here together, and check it on the wire.
