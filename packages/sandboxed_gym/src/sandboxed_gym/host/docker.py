"""A job-host provider that runs the Gym host in a local Docker container.

The OpenSandbox provider needs a Kubernetes control plane and PVC claims, so until one is available
the sandboxed path cannot be *executed* at all -- only its wiring tested with the provider replaced.
This provider closes that gap: same runtime image contract, same bootstrap environment, same HTTP
health and rollout endpoints, on a laptop.

**It is not an isolation boundary.** A Docker container is not kata-qemu, this provider enforces no
egress policy, and it mounts host directories rather than cluster-managed volumes. The
sandboxed-GRPO RFC's threat model is not satisfied by any of that. What it is for is executing and
debugging the path -- and for that, running the real Gym is worth far more than a stub.

``egress_allow`` is therefore accepted and *recorded* rather than applied, and reading it back off
the handle is how a test can assert what a cluster provider would have enforced.
