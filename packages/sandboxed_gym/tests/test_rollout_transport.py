"""How a rollout batch reaches the Gym host and how its failures are classified.

Two hops can refuse a rollout and they say so differently: the Gym host wraps its own failures as
a nested ``{"error": {...}}``, while the sandbox proxy answers with a flat ``{"code", "message"}``
-- and does so when its read timeout fires, where the message is empty. Confusing the two turns a
proxy giving up into "the environment failed", which sends the reader to the wrong system.
