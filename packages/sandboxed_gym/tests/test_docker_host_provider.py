"""Tests for the Docker job-host provider's translation of a host spec into container arguments.

Provisioning itself needs a Docker daemon and a runtime image, so what is covered here is the part
that decides *where things land*: claim and sub-path resolution, read-only enforcement, and the
recorded egress a cluster provider would apply. Those are the pieces that silently do the wrong
thing rather than failing.
