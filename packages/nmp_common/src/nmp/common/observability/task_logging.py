"""Platform task-logging provider.

Registered under the ``nemo.logging_provider`` entry-point group so
:func:`nemo_platform_plugin.tasks.logging_setup.configure_task_logging` picks
it up in any image where ``nmp-common`` is installed. This is the
:mod:`nmp.common.client_factory` pattern applied to logging: the plugin
package declares the seam and keeps no dependency on ``nmp-common``, while the
platform supplies the real implementation.

The effect is that a task container's output is the same structured stream a
service emits - same renderer, same level handling, same sensitive-data
filters - so log aggregation does not have to treat task logs as a special
case. Without this provider the plugin's built-in default gives a task plain
stderr lines, which is readable but unstructured.
