## NeMo Platform Gym Tasks Container

This container provides the Gym and Ray runtime for trusted deployments that run
Gym directly inside an agent-evaluation task. Sandboxed Gym evaluations use the
shared CPU tasks container to orchestrate a separate Gym host, keeping Gym and
Ray outside the task container.
