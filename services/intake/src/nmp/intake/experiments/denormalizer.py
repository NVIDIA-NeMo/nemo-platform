"""Denormalizes agent/model name fields from ClickHouse onto Evaluation entities.

Ingest marks ``(workspace, evaluation_name)`` dirty; a background loop recomputes each touched
evaluation's rollup and writes the distinct ``agent_names``/``agent_versions``/``model_names`` sets onto
the (system-managed) fields of its Evaluation entity. That lets the Evaluations list filter by
agent/model name against the entity store (``$contains``) instead of scanning the ClickHouse session
table on every request.

Only the name fields are denormalized, never the computed metric rollups: names are raw observed
strings with no formula, so a change to how an aggregate is computed can never invalidate them.

The start/stop lifecycle comes from :class:`nmp.intake.background_worker.BackgroundWorker`; the
debouncing (a coalescing dirty set drained on a fixed cadence) lives here because it is specific to how
this worker refreshes evaluations.
