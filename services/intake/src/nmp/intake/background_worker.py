"""A background task with a managed start/stop lifecycle.

Runs a subclass's ``_run()`` coroutine as a single asyncio ``Task``: ``start()`` launches it and
``stop()`` signals it (via ``self._stopping``) and awaits its exit. It never cancels mid-run, so an
in-flight iteration finishes before ``stop()`` returns. Subclasses own what the loop actually does.

Intake-agnostic; a candidate to move to ``nmp.common`` if another service wants the same lifecycle.
