"""Every span filter Intake publishes must reach SQL.

``SpanFilter`` is the published contract, so a field in it that cannot be served is a
promise the API does not keep. Five of them once resolved to span attributes with no
catalog entry, so ``spec_for_field`` raised ``ValueError`` deep in the repository and the
request failed with HTTP 500 and the body "An unexpected error occurred."

These tests walk the whole chain that broke: filter JSON, then the API filter builder,
then the SQL builder.
