    The shared callback's naming rule is that the backend supplies its

    arrives pre-prefixed comes back doubled. Stripping is what makes ``val_loss``
    land as ``val_loss`` rather than ``val_val_loss``.

    It applies to every name, not just ``val_loss``, because the recipes are
    inconsistent about which metrics they prefix: ``train_ft`` reports
    ``val_loss`` alongside a bare ``lr`` and ``num_label_tokens``, and
    ``train_bi_encoder`` adds ``val_acc1`` and ``val_mrr``. Only the callback
    should be deciding the phase, so the prefix comes off wherever the recipe
    happened to put one.

    Stripping can collide: a dict carrying both ``val_loss`` and ``loss`` maps
    them onto one name, and whichever lands second silently replaces the other.
    None of today's recipes do that, but nothing stops one from starting, and the
    failure would read as a validation curve charting the wrong quantity. The
