"""Client/server contract for optimistic-locking deletes.

``expected_db_version`` is built as a query param by ``EntityClient`` and read back
by the delete route's ``Query(...)`` declaration. Nothing else pins those two names
to each other:

- the client-side unit tests assert the key the client builds, against a mock
- the repository tests exercise the version check with no HTTP involved
- the endpoint tests assert query params reach ``PreparedRequest``, using a literal

So a rename on either side leaves every one of those green while silently turning a
guarded delete into an unconditional one, which is the exact TOCTOU hole the guard
was added to close.

These tests run a real ``EntityClient`` against a live entities app, so the query
string is genuinely built, sent, parsed and honoured.
