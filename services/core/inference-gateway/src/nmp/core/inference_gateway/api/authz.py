"""Request-time authorization for the inference proxy path.

The shared ``AuthMiddleware`` route gate authorizes every request against the
PDP, but for a **service principal** the PDP takes the ServiceSystem bypass
(wildcard permission) and does not narrow on the ``on-behalf-of`` identity. That
is correct for genuine internal callers that act only as themselves, but a
service principal that delegates (e.g. an agent deployment acting as its creator
via ``X-NMP-Principal-On-Behalf-Of``) must not inherit that platform-wide reach:
its access should be scoped to what the delegated user can reach.

The proxy handlers themselves do no per-caller access control (they resolve
models/providers from in-memory caches), so this module adds the missing check:
when the caller is a *delegated* service principal, verify the on-behalf-of user
holds the endpoint's required permission in the target workspace. Non-delegated
callers are untouched — plain users are already gated by the route gate, and a
non-delegated service principal keeps the existing bypass.
