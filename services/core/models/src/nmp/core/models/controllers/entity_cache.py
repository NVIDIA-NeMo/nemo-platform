"""Batched reads and writes of Model Entities for a single reconciliation phase.

Reconciling providers and deployments requires looking at the Model Entity behind
every served model, and often needs to link or unlink a provider on it. Doing that
one entity at a time costs two round trips per served model per pass, which grows
with the product of providers and the size of their model catalogues.

:class:`ModelEntityCache` reads the entities once per phase and accumulates the
intended changes, so each entity is written at most once and only when something
actually differs. Because the desired state for an entity is assembled in memory
before it is written, concurrent contributions from several providers cannot
overwrite one another.
