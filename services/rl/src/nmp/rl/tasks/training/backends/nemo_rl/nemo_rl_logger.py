# This logger no longer throttles. Bounding the report count is
# TrainingProgressCallback's job now, on both paths and for all three backends --
# NeMo-RL was the only one that did it, and the other two paid quadratically for
# the absence. What lived here (a per-run report budget, a train-step modulus, a
# validation-pass counter, and a pending/flush pair) moved there wholesale; the
# validation counter was also replaced rather than moved, because counting
# reports rather than distinct steps split a multi-dataloader pass across the
# admit/hold boundary and burned the budget N times faster with N dataloaders.
#
# What remains is an adapter: route by prefix, qualify validation metrics by
# dataloader, derive the epoch, and dedupe the rollout log.

#: What a preference-learning run is read on, beyond the shared diagnostics.
#: Together with :data:`DIAGNOSTIC_TIME_SERIES` these select fourteen of the twenty
#: metrics DPO reports (eleven on the train path, nine on validation); the six left
#: out are accounting counters -- ``num_valid_samples``, ``global_valid_seqs``,
#: ``global_valid_toks`` on both phases -- whose current value is all anyone reads.
#:
#: Patterns rather than literal names so each entry covers both phases and the whole
#: family. That is mostly load-bearing over in ``DIAGNOSTIC_TIME_SERIES``, whose
#: ``*_loss`` picks up ``train_sft_loss`` and ``val_preference_loss`` as well as the
#: two plain losses -- and picks them up for a second validation dataloader too,
#: whose names NeMo-RL qualifies with the dataset (``val_heldout_loss``).
DPO_TIME_SERIES_METRICS = (
    "*_accuracy",
    "*_rewards_chosen_mean",
    "*_rewards_rejected_mean",
)

#: GRPO's own read-on set. The DPO list is preference-learning shaped -- its one
#: reward entry, ``*_rewards_chosen_mean``, matches nothing GRPO emits -- so before
#: this a GRPO run stored four curves out of roughly eighty metrics, and the reward
#: was not among them. A policy-gradient run is read on reward first and on the
#: off-policy diagnostics second; those are the two things a stored history answers
#: and a current value cannot.
#:
#: Names carry ``/`` (``advantages/mean``), which ``*`` matches like any other
#: character, so a family is reachable with one entry.
#: Left out deliberately, as current values only: the ``/max /min /median``
#: siblings of every rollout family, the accounting counters
#: (``global_valid_toks``, ``num_valid_samples``, ``total_num_tokens``), and the
#: ratio-clipping bounds, which are read as "where is it now", not as a curve.
#: ``total_reward/stddev`` is the one sibling that is in: it says how much the
#: rewards in a step varied, which no other metric here says.
#:
#: Two more are left out for reasons particular to this service, since each looks
#: like an obvious inclusion:
#:
#: ``*total_reward/mean`` is the NeMo-Gym aggregator's reward. On this service it is
#: the same number as ``train_reward``: both average the same
#: ``full_result["reward"]`` values, because the three settings that could make them
#: differ (``reward_scaling``, ``reward_shaping``, ``use_dynamic_sampling``) are all
#: turned off. Add it back if any of those is ever exposed as a knob.
#:
#: One thing to know before adding its validation half: ``validate()`` resets
#: ``additional_metrics_to_report`` on each batch, so every ``val_`` rollout metric
#: holds the last batch rather than the whole pass. That does not bite today only
#: because ``grpo_driver`` sets ``val_batch_size = max_val_samples``, so a pass is
#: one batch. If that changes, ``val_truncation_rate`` and the rest quietly start
#: describing the tail of the validation set instead of all of it.
#:
#: ``*_rewards_chosen_mean``/``_rejected_mean`` are DPO's, and match nothing here.
GRPO_TIME_SERIES_METRICS = (
    # Train reward: the mean over the step's batch, which is what the loss optimized.
    # A pattern rather than the literal name so it also matches
    # `train_filtered_reward` if `use_dynamic_sampling` is ever turned on -- the only
    # case where the filtered and unfiltered rewards differ and both are worth a

    # what the environment returned, and a gap between them is the transform working rather
    # than the policy moving. Train-only, not `*total_reward/mean`: the validation spelling

#: What each driver passes as its ``default_time_series_metrics``: the shared

#: like ``loss``, which selects nothing. A union makes it fire on every healthy run
#: (a DPO run would name every GRPO pattern and vice versa), and a warning that
#: always fires cannot distinguish the typo it was built for. The union also made
#: each algorithm carry the other's payload for nothing.
#:
#: Adding an algorithm means adding its tuple and passing it from its driver. There
#: is deliberately no combined constant to fall back on: a new driver that forgets
#: gets :data:`DIAGNOSTIC_TIME_SERIES` and loses its own metrics' history, which is
#: recoverable and visible in the log, rather than silently inheriting two other

        The first prefix seen keeps the bare names, so ``val_loss`` stays
        ``val_loss`` on the ordinary single-dataset run. NeMo-RL names that
        dataloader too, so keying on "did a name arrive" would rename the common
        case and take Studio's curve with it. Iteration order over the dataloader
        dict is stable within a run and across a resume of the same config, so a
        dataset keeps whichever naming it started with.
