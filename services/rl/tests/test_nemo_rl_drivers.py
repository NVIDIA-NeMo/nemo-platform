"""Source-level checks that the drivers tear the progress logger down.

These are tripwires, not behaviour tests. The drivers cannot be imported outside
the training image -- they pull in nemo_rl, ray and omegaconf at module scope --
so the wiring is asserted against the AST instead.

It is worth asserting at all because the failure is silent: NeMo-RL never closes
the loggers it is handed, so if these calls are dropped the final training step
stops being reported and every unit test still passes.
