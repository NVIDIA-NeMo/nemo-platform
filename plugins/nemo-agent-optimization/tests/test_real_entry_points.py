"""Resolve every agent-optimize strategy from real, installed entry points.

Every other test touching :func:`discover_agent_optimize_jobs` monkeypatches
``discover_jobs``, so a typo or stale path in any strategy plugin's
``pyproject.toml`` ``[project.entry-points."nemo.jobs"]`` table would never
surface as a test failure. This test calls the real, unpatched
``discover_agent_optimize_jobs()`` so it actually resolves the ``nat`` entry
point installed in this environment.

That test alone does not guard the bundled wrapper manifest
(``packages/nemo_platform/pyproject.toml``): that package is a permanent
``[tool.uv.workspace]`` member, so both the standalone plugin distribution
and the bundled wrapper distribution register the same ``*.agent_optimize``
entry-point name in any dev/CI environment, and ``entry_points()`` lookup
dedups same-named entries with no guaranteed winner. A typo introduced only
in the wrapper manifest could be masked by the correct standalone entry and
the test above would still pass. The second test here reads the wrapper
manifest directly as data (no entry-point resolution involved), so a typo
there fails regardless of what any installed distribution registers.
