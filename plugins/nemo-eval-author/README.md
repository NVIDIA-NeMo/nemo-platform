# NeMo Eval Author

Skills that an agent reads to work on the evaluation suites in a user's own
repository, derive private environments from trace evidence, and understand
traces from NeMo Intake. This directory provides no
installed public package or service, so a customer points their agent at
`skills/` and nothing gets installed.

The audit sub-flow also ships a bundled validator CLI at
[`skills/eval-author-audit/scripts/audit_spec/validate.py`](skills/eval-author-audit/scripts/audit_spec/validate.py)
and private helper modules under `scripts/audit_spec/`. They are invoked from the
copied skill tree, not published as a package API.

## Prerequisites

Discovery imports nothing beyond the standard library and Harbor itself, so it
runs on whatever Python the customer already has. Audit validation needs PyYAML
to read the marked YAML block and jsonschema to enforce
`schemas/audit.schema.json`. Trace inspection requires the supported `nemo` CLI,
an explicit workspace, and read access to a configured local or remote NeMo
Platform instance.

`tests/test_skill_contract.py` holds to the same boundary and imports nothing
from the platform, so `pytest`, `pyyaml`, and `jsonschema` are enough to run it.
The five tests that make Harbor judge a fixture suite skip when Harbor is absent,
which is why this directory declares no dependencies and appears in no dependency
group.

| Skill | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`eval-author`](skills/eval-author/SKILL.md) | Core. Owns the standard every sub-flow follows and routes to one. |
| [`eval-author-discover`](skills/eval-author-discover/SKILL.md) | Sub-flow. Records whether a repository's Harbor evals are ready to run. |
| [`eval-author-audit`](skills/eval-author-audit/SKILL.md) | Sub-flow. Validates an existing finite `audit.md` coverage denominator. |
| [`eval-author-inspect-trace`](skills/eval-author-inspect-trace/SKILL.md) | Sub-flow. Not user-invocable. Explains one Intake trace after `eval-author` selects it. |
| [`eval-author-task-create`](skills/eval-author-task-create/SKILL.md) | Sub-flow. Creates and proves one Harbor task from an actionable audit gap. |
| [`eval-author-trace-environment`](skills/eval-author-trace-environment/SKILL.md) | Sub-flow. Converts one canonicalized trace into a private candidate, inventories ground truth and software constraints, and builds a reproducible Harbor task environment when supported. |
| [`mlflow-to-atif`](skills/mlflow-to-atif/SKILL.md) | Utility. Normalizes bounded MLflow exports to canonical ATIF. |

## Where findings go

`eval-author-discover` leaves a report at `.eval-author/discovery.md`, carrying the
JSON as front matter so a later model reads the verdict without Harbor. It is
visible and worth committing: a teammate who reads it skips the discovery pass.

`eval-author-inspect-trace` leaves one report per trace under
`.eval-author/traces/`. The front matter carries Intake source metadata and the
exact read commands. Findings use `behavior`, `issue`, `recovery`, and
`uncertainty` categories.

`eval-author-trace-environment` creates one owner-private, gitignored workspace
per task under `.eval-author/trace-environments/`. Each finalized workspace has
a `candidate` or `no_candidate` summary and keeps restricted source evidence
separate from its text-only scrubbed ATIF copy.

Discovery scripts write no files and trace inspection contains instructions
only. The authoring helpers report to stdout and write only their documented
artifacts under `.eval-author/`.

## Why skills instead of an agent

Harbor tasks live in the customer's repository, so an agent that proposes changes
has to write to that repository. Customers were unwilling to grant that, sandboxed
or not. A skill inverts the arrangement: the customer's own agent does the work,
and this directory only supplies the instructions and the deterministic scripts.

The Eval Author agent that Experimentalist insight mode still uses lives in
[the Experimentalist plugin](../nemo-experimentalist/src/nemo_experimentalist_plugin/eval_author/README.md).

## Dependencies

Adding a runtime dependency to a bundled script is a breaking change for anyone who
copied the skill, so the contract test walks each script's imports and fails on
anything outside the standard library, a sibling module, or the explicitly allowed
third-party validators.

Trace inspection uses read-only `nemo intake` commands. The CLI handles its
contexts, authentication, transport, filters, pagination, and errors.

## Next Steps

- Start with [`eval-author`](skills/eval-author/SKILL.md) to select the right
  sub-flow and apply the shared evaluation standard.
- Use [`eval-author-discover`](skills/eval-author-discover/SKILL.md) to check
  whether a Harbor suite can run.
- Use [`eval-author-audit`](skills/eval-author-audit/SKILL.md) to validate an
  existing finite `audit.md` coverage denominator.
- After `eval-author` selects it, follow
  [`eval-author-inspect-trace`](skills/eval-author-inspect-trace/SKILL.md) to
  explain one Intake trace.
- Use [`eval-author-trace-environment`](skills/eval-author-trace-environment/SKILL.md)
  to derive a private, evidence-backed environment from one trace.
