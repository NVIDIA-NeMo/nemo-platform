"""Intake trace querying for standalone Eval Author.

Two raw queries and one composite.

``query_spans`` and ``query_traces`` pass a filter straight to Intake and return
plain rows. The agent writes its own filters, so it can ask for error spans of
one tool, or the traces of one evaluation case, without a new method here.
Server-side filtering is exact, which client-side counting over a capped page
never is.

``find_agent_traces`` exists because no single endpoint answers "the recent
traces of this agent". Only spans carry ``agent_name``, so ``traces.list``
cannot be scoped to an agent. The composite groups spans by trace id to get the
recent ones, then reads the summary of exactly those ids. It is built on the two
raw queries, so it is also a worked example of composing them.

Reading and diagnosis are delegated, not rebuilt: ``read_trace`` calls
``TraceExplorer`` and ``analyze_trace`` calls ``TraceAnalyzer``.

Failure-mode discovery stays with the Analyst. Nothing here clusters traces.

    Use this to choose which traces to open, not to read what happened. A span is one
    step of a trajectory, and read on its own it omits what led to it and what followed.
    A slow call may be slow because of the retry before it; an error may be the handled
    kind that the next span recovers from. Every row carries ``trace_ref``, so open the
    trace with ``read_trace`` before you treat a span as evidence, quote it, or build a
    test case from it.

    Args:
        client: Platform client.
        workspace: Workspace to search.
        filter: Intake span filter, sent to the server. Combine fields to narrow
            server-side. Every field takes one exact value, except ``started_at``:

            - identity: ``trace_id``, ``session_id``, ``parent_span_id`` (the direct
              children of one span)
            - agent: ``agent_name``, ``agent_id``

              ``status`` (``success``, ``error``, ``cancelled``, ``unknown``),
              ``tool_name``, ``model``, ``provider``
            - context: ``project``, ``source``, ``evaluation_id``, ``test_case_id``
            - time: ``started_at`` as ``{"gte": ..., "lte": ...}``, either bound or both

            No other field is filterable, and ``$in`` is not accepted here: only
            ``id`` on ``query_traces`` takes a list.
        group_by: When set, roll the matching spans up server-side into one row per
            group. Only ``"trace_id"`` and ``"session_id"`` are groupable. Use this to
            get the distinct traces of any filter, then pass those ids to
            ``query_traces``.
        sort: ``"-started_at"`` (default, newest first) or ``"started_at"``. Grouped
            results also take ``"-span_count"`` and ``"span_count"``, for the busiest
            traces rather than the newest. A group's time is its earliest matching
            span, so ``"-started_at"`` returns the traces whose matching work began
            most recently.
        mode: ``"summary"`` omits payloads, ``"preview"`` truncates them, ``"detailed"``
            returns them in full. Stay on ``"summary"``, which is all that choosing a
            trace needs. Payloads pulled from many traces at once are the fragments this
            docstring warns about; ``read_trace`` gives you the same text in context.
        limit: Maximum rows to return. Clamped to ``MAX_ROW_LIMIT``.

    Returns:
        Flat: ``{"spans": [...], "count": int, "truncated": bool}``. Grouped:

        where a group is ``{"group": {...}, "span_count": int, "started_at": str}``.
        A group's counts and time cover only the spans that matched, so use
        ``query_traces`` for whole-trace totals. Rows that belong to a
        trace also carry ``trace_ref`` for ``read_trace``. ``truncated`` means that more
        rows matched than ``limit``, so narrow the filter or raise ``limit``.
