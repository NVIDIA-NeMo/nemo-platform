                Use this as the authoritative reference for what artifacts exist at
                evaluation runtime, how tasks are structured, and how to add metrics.

                the previous metric-authoring attempt. If provided, repair every reported
                file before returning.

        Refer to ``self.context["dataset_documentation"]`` for the dataset-specific API
        and metric authoring conventions (file layout, how to add/remove/modify a metric).

        **Scope: every task in all three datasets**

        Add at least one new Insight-specific metric key to every task in
        ``train_dataset``, ``validation_dataset``, and ``insight_suite``. Use the same
        new metric key set and scoring semantics everywhere. Preserve every existing
        verifier metric, including ordinary ``reward`` or ``score`` values.

        Task-specific verifier edits are allowed and expected when existing verifier
        layouts differ. Only edit verifier files. Do not modify task instructions,
        environments, solutions, or other agent-visible inputs.

        Name each new metric after the root-cause behavior, not a trace id or surface
        symptom. Measure the current Harbor run from runtime artifacts such as OTLP
        traces or agent outputs. Do not hard-code scores for the production traces that
        motivated the Insight.

        In every task's configured verifier directory, write ``metric-contract.json``
        containing exactly ``{"metric_keys": ["key_one", "key_two"]}``. The list must
        contain the same newly authored keys for every task and must exactly match the
        ``metric_keys`` returned in ``MetricAuthoringResult``.

        **Validate while authoring**

        After verifier edits, call ``await train_dataset.validate()``,
        ``await validation_dataset.validate()``, and ``await insight_suite.validate()``.
        These perform evaluator-specific static checks without launching trials. If one
        raises ``DatasetValidationError``, repair its diagnostics and revalidate all three.
        If ``validation_feedback`` is provided, fix every reported failure before returning.

        **Metric quality**

        Focus the metric on the root cause, not the surface symptom.  Prefer graded
        partial scores over binary 0/1 whenever the evidence supports measuring severity,
        frequency, or progress toward the desired behavior.  Use binary scores only when
        the behavior is genuinely all-or-nothing.  For LLM judges: instruct the judge to
        return calibrated partial-credit floats with a short rationale, not pass/fail.

        **Metric scale — higher is always better, never use raw counts**

        Every metric value must be a float in ``[0.0, 1.0]`` where ``1.0`` means perfect
        and ``0.0`` means complete failure.  Raw counts (error_count, call_count, …) are
        forbidden as metric values — they have no upper bound and make optimization
        direction ambiguous.  Convert counts to rates or invert them:

        - Error rate → ``max(0.0, 1.0 - errors / total_calls)``
        - Presence of a behavior → ``1.0`` if present, ``0.0`` if absent
        - Partial credit → fraction of required steps completed correctly

        Example: the symptom is that the agent fails to return X when a customer asks for Y.
        The root cause is that the agent does not retrieve the full set of relevant database
        objects for Y, so X is missing from its context.  Measure whether the agent retrieves
        all required objects, not merely whether X appears in the final answer.

        Return ``MetricAuthoringResult`` with the unique, non-empty ``metric_keys`` added
        by the verifier edits plus a concise summary. Include at least one
        Insight-specific key beyond generic ``reward`` or ``score``.
