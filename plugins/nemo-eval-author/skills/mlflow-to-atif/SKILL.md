description: >-
  Convert bounded live MLflow traces or exported Trace.to_dict() JSON into one
  canonical ATIF trajectory per trace for Harbor or Eval Author audit coverage.
  Use for MLflow-to-ATIF conversion, not Intake ingestion.
triggers:
  - convert MLflow traces to ATIF
  - prepare an MLflow trace for an ATIF consumer
  - measure Eval Author audit coverage from an MLflow run
not-for:
  - nemo-intake (use to import MLflow into Intake or query normalized spans)
  - eval-author-inspect-trace (use to explain one trace that is already in Intake)
  - eval-author-audit (use after this skill emits ATIF to measure audit coverage)
compatibility: >-
  Offline conversion uses Python 3.11+ and the standard library. Live queries
  require an existing Python environment with MLflow. Optional reference
  validation requires Harbor. Output is ATIF v1.7 for current downstream
  compatibility.

# Convert MLflow to ATIF

Produce canonical ATIF without routing trace data through Intake. The bundled
script writes one owner-private `.atif.json` file per MLflow trace and prints
only a content-free summary.

## Protect the trace

Treat the source and converted files as restricted data unless the user proves
otherwise. Do not print trace payloads, place them in Git, or write them into a
public or shared output directory. The script makes its output directory mode
`0700` and trajectory files mode `0600`.

## Choose the input

For exported data, accept one `Trace.to_dict()` value, a JSON array of those
values, or an object shaped as `{"traces": [...]}`:

```bash
python scripts/convert_mlflow_to_atif.py \
  --input <private-export.json> \
  --output-dir <private-atif-dir> \
  --agent-name <stable-agent-name> \
  --agent-version <agent-version>
```

For a live MLflow store, require an explicit experiment and bounded time range.
Use a Python environment where MLflow is already available; do not install it
or change MLflow authentication on the user's behalf:

```bash
python scripts/convert_mlflow_to_atif.py \
  --tracking-uri <mlflow-uri> \
  --experiment-id <experiment-id> \
  --since <inclusive-ISO-8601-time> \
  --until <exclusive-ISO-8601-time> \
  --output-dir <private-atif-dir> \
  --agent-name <stable-agent-name> \
  --agent-version <agent-version>
```

The script refuses to overwrite an existing trajectory unless the user asks to
replace the same conversion and `--overwrite` is supplied.

## Version and validation

Emit ATIF v1.7 and add `--validate-with-harbor` when Harbor is installed.

ATIF v1.8 is newer and adds audio content parts. This converter currently
projects MLflow text and JSON data only, so v1.8 adds no needed representation.
Move the converter and downstream consumers to v1.8 together when they support
that version; do not relabel v1.7 output as v1.8.

## Conversion contract

- Recover the human instruction from the root span or trace input. Fail instead
  of inventing an instruction when none exists.
- Emit LLM spans as agent steps and preserve model and token metrics when MLflow
  recorded them.
- Emit tool, retriever, embedding, reranker, and guardrail spans as deterministic
  agent steps with paired tool calls and observations.
- Flatten the span tree into timestamp order while retaining native IDs, parent
  IDs, attributes, events, status, and assessments under namespaced `mlflow`
  metadata.
- Reject unresolved parents, cycles, and exported search pages with a non-empty
  `next_page_token`; collect the complete export before conversion.
- Distinguish missing, explicit null, and populated tool outputs in each result's
  `extra.mlflow.output_state`.
- Record every known lossy projection under
  `extra.mlflow_to_atif.loss_codes`.

After conversion, pass one emitted file to the downstream consumer as canonical
ATIF. Keep restricted originals separate from sanitized output.
