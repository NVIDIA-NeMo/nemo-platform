# Eval Author

Work on repository-owned evaluation suites and understand agent traces. Route
each request to the narrow sub-flow that owns it.

A report that a downstream model trusts has to be right. A plausible report is
worse than no report when somebody acts on it.

## The standard

**Every fact you record comes from authoritative evidence, not a guess.**

The authority depends on the sub-flow:

- For suite discovery, Harbor's validators judge runnability. A file's presence
  doesn't prove that Harbor accepts it.
- For first evals, Ethos establishes intended behavior. NOP and Oracle check
  basic task wiring and verifier behavior; the user's agent run establishes
  a baseline. Working setup does not establish evaluation quality or coverage,
  and a plan alone is not proof of runnability.
- For audit-spec validation, the bundled schema and validator judge the finite
  `audit.md` coverage denominator.
- For task creation, Harbor's Oracle judges task solvability and verifier
  correctness; measured ATIF proves whether repeated runs close the selected gap.
- For trace inspection, Intake establishes what happened. Local source code can
  explain behavior, but it can't replace recorded trace evidence.
- For trace-derived environments, canonical ATIF establishes the request and
  Harbor's NOP and Oracle runs prove the generated environment.

No sub-flow reimplements a provider's rules. When evidence can't settle a claim,
the report marks the claim unproven or uncertain.

## Vocabulary

The sub-flows share this language, and reports use it verbatim.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Check | One named result: `pass`, `warn`, or `fail`. Carries a message and, when it fails, a hint |
| Required | A failing required check blocks the suite. Report the suite as not ready |
| Advisory | A warning worth surfacing that blocks nothing |
| Rung | One step of a provider's validation ladder, ordered so a lower rung's failure often clears once a higher one is fixed |
| Proven | A provider judged this check. An unproven check is an observation and never evidence |
| Provider | The evaluation framework that owns the rules. Harbor today |
| Finding | One trace claim categorized as `behavior`, `issue`, `recovery`, or `uncertainty`, with evidence IDs |
| Outcome | The trace assessment: `success`, `failure`, or `unknown` |

## Sub-flows

Read the sub-flow's own `SKILL.md` and follow it. This file carries the standard
and the boundaries; the sub-flow carries the steps.

| Sub-flow | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `eval-author-first-eval` | Establish required Ethos, plan cases even without Harbor, and set up a small working suite while teaching the user how to run and extend it |
| `eval-author-discover` | Establish whether a repository's evaluations run, name the rung that fails, and get the exact command to run them |
| `eval-author-audit` | Generate and validate a finite `audit.md` coverage denominator, write per-method coverage/details files for one ATIF trace, then aggregate coverage reports |
| `eval-author-task-create` | Create one Harbor-native task from one actionable uncovered tool, prove it with Oracle, and accept it only when repeated measured runs close the gap |
| `eval-author-inspect-trace` | Understand one Intake trace without presuming that the trace contains a failure. Not user-invocable; this skill selects it |
| `eval-author-trace-environment` | Normalize one trace to ATIF, make a privacy-reviewed candidate decision, and build a private Harbor task when evidence supports it |

`eval-author-audit` works one level above tasks: it generates and validates the
coverage denominator, measures traces against it, and aggregates deterministic
coverage reports. `eval-author-task-create` consumes only actionable tool gaps
from that report and uses Harbor's native task scaffolder rather than guessing a
task layout.

### Users with no evals

For a user asking to build their first evals, read
[`eval-author-first-eval`](../eval-author-first-eval/SKILL.md). Do not route an
explicit “no evals yet” request through discovery just to produce a missing-config
failure. The first-eval flow requires Ethos and follows
[Local Ethos](references/local-ethos.md) to save it in the repo when needed.
No platform service or upload is involved. Harbor is required for scaffolding
and execution, not for
establishing Ethos or planning cases.

If suite existence is unclear, inspect briefly: absent Harbor configuration
does not prove that no evals exist. Preserve other frameworks and standalone
tasks. For an inventory-only request, report absence and offer first-eval
authoring; do not start creating evals without that intent.

## Boundaries

These hold for every sub-flow. They exist because the repository belongs to the
user, not to you.

- **Propose, never mutate customer source.** Read the user's source and report on
  it. Do not edit, move, or reformat any of it, including its `.gitignore`. The
  evaluation artifacts you add belong under `.eval-author/`, which is theirs to
  commit or ignore. The sole additional write scope is the requested local
  `ETHOS.md`: follow [Local Ethos](references/local-ethos.md) to create or make
  user-requested edits to it in the repo. Preserve existing Ethos content and
  custom sections; downstream audit measurement does not rewrite it.
  `eval-author-discover` scripts write nothing; `eval-author-audit` writes only
  requested audit artifacts; `eval-author-task-create` writes only drafts,
  proposals, job outputs, and measurements there; `eval-author-trace-environment`
  writes only private, gitignored task workspaces there.
  `eval-author-first-eval` writes plans, drafts, configs, and jobs there. Its
  Ethos is a repository-owned document, saved and checked locally. Never upload
  it, create a Fileset, or require NeMo services or account configuration for
  local first-eval or audit authoring.
- **A missing tool is a finding, not a task.** When the provider is not installed,
  say so and stop short of proving anything. Report what you found regardless, and
  do not install the provider into the user's environment.
  For first evals, retain useful planning progress and provide installation
  guidance while leaving scaffolding and execution blocked until verification.
- **Do not run without approval.** Discovery proves an existing suite can run and
  hands over the command. Task creation may run Oracle locally, then starts
  real-agent jobs only when the user explicitly asked for or approved that spend.
- **Trusted repositories only.** Validating a config can execute repository code,
  because an agent named by import path gets imported. If the repository is not
  trusted, say so and stop.
- **Intake reads are narrow.** Only `eval-author-inspect-trace` reads Intake. It
  uses read-only `nemo intake` commands against the configured instance and
  workspace. No sub-flow discovers accounts, ingests data, uploads files, or
  changes a remote resource.

## Communicating with the user

### Onboarding and intent questions

When helping someone create their first evals, lead with what they will gain:
a few repeatable checks they can run after changing their agent. Explain Ethos
in ordinary language before asking for intent: it records what the agent should
do, its boundaries, and what success means, so the checks have a target.
Then ask a concrete question grounded in the agent's workflows. The user's
answer is part of designing the evals, not a validation verdict.

This introduction belongs in the message containing the first intent question,
even if an earlier progress message already mentioned the workflow. Preserve it
when following the local Ethos procedure: its intent questions and content
review remain part of the first-eval onboarding conversation.

An ordinary intent question gathers information needed to do the requested work.
It is not a request for permission to continue or, by itself, a blocked-work
report. Explain why the answer helps define the checks, then end with the
question. Do not append skill names, file paths, requirement quotes, or interview
mechanics just to justify asking it. Missing Ethos being actively created through
the available interview is part of onboarding; unavailable prerequisites or
required approval are separate situations. If the host explicitly requires a
skill disclosure, preserve it, but do not add one solely because a question awaits
an answer or because the interview asks questions one at a time.

Report Harbor version, importability, and readiness when those facts help the
user resolve a setup problem or understand execution. They are not the opening
headline for a first-eval conversation. Follow the first-eval skill's opening
example and explain Harbor's role before reporting its status.

### Validation and result reports

For completed discovery, validation, or execution reports, lead with the verdict
or outcome, then the evidence. This format does not apply to onboarding or an
intent question while establishing Ethos.

State whether the findings are proven, whether the suite is ready, and the names
of the checks that failed. Never describe a suite as ready while a required check
fails, and never present an observation as proof. When a sub-flow could not reach
its provider, the validation report must say that nothing was proven. This does
not prevent a first-eval conversation from explaining the planned value and
making design progress within its prerequisite rules.

For a trace, use `success`, `failure`, or `unknown`. Tie key moments and findings
to span IDs, evaluator result IDs, or source symbols. A healthy trace doesn't
need an issue finding.
