# Eval Author: trace to environment

Read `eval-author` for the shared evidence standard and boundaries. This flow
uses the current coding agent to turn one recorded interaction into one small,
reproducible Harbor task. It does not require a particular coding agent, model,
or framework.

```text
bounded source → canonical ATIF → private text scrub → contextual audit
                                                        └─ candidate decision
                                                           ├─ no_candidate → summary
                                                           └─ candidate → isolated Harbor proof → review → summary
```

The ATIF file is the only handoff into candidate analysis. Keep exact source
exports restricted. Do not put trace payloads, credentials, or generated task
workspaces in Git.

## Artifact contract

Use one workspace per task:

```text
.eval-author/trace-environments/
  .gitignore
  <task-id>/
    private/source.atif.json
    private/canonical.atif.json
    private/privacy-audit.json
    private/publications/<digest>/
    private/publication-review.json
    private/ground-truth/
    safe/trace.atif.json
    safe/privacy.json
    candidate.json
    task/
    reproducibility.json
    validation.json
    summary.json
    summary.md
```

The original bytes, normalized canonical ATIF, safe ATIF, privacy report, audit,
ground truth, and Harbor jobs stay ignored. The declassified reproducibility
manifest is published only through the helper's whitelist-only `export` command.

`scripts/trace_environment.py init` writes the parent `.gitignore` so every
task directory is ignored, makes directories owner-only, and refuses to replace
an existing task workspace. The helper prints content-free JSON summaries.

## Step 1: create the private task workspace

Choose a stable lowercase kebab-case task ID. Derive it from a caller-supplied
case name or trace ID; do not put a person's name, email address, account number,
or other private value in it.

```bash
python <skill_dir>/scripts/trace_environment.py init \
  --task-id <task-id>
```

Keep every source export and intermediate conversion under the returned task
directory. Use `umask 077` before redirecting provider output there.

## Step 2: normalize exactly one source to ATIF

Do not merge unrelated traces. Preserve the source's trace and span identifiers
in `extra`, order steps by recorded time, and record every missing or lossy field
under `extra.normalization.uncertainties` or `extra.normalization.losses`.
Never invent an instruction, tool result, file, or final answer.

### Existing ATIF

Use the trajectory as the canonical input. Do not relabel its ATIF version.

### MLflow

Read and follow `mlflow-to-atif`. Put its owner-private output under the task
workspace and use the emitted `.atif.json` file as the canonical input.

### Intake

Resolve the CLI exactly as `eval-author-inspect-trace` specifies. Read one exact
trace and every detailed span into owner-private JSON files:

```bash
umask 077
nemo intake traces get --output-format=json --workspace="WORKSPACE" --mode=detailed "TRACE_ID" > <task-dir>/private/intake-trace.json
nemo intake spans list --output-format=json --workspace="WORKSPACE" --filter.trace-id="TRACE_ID" --mode=detailed --sort=started_at --all-pages > <task-dir>/private/intake-spans.json
```

Require every returned span's `trace_id` to match the selected trace. The coding
agent converts those records to ATIF: root input becomes the user instruction;
model or assistant output becomes agent steps; each tool span becomes a paired
tool call and observation; errors and unmapped attributes remain cited in
`extra.intake`. If there is no complete human instruction, record no_candidate.

### OpenTelemetry

Prefer an existing Intake trace produced from the telemetry and use the Intake
path above. For a bounded JSON OTLP export, the coding agent may map the root and
descendant spans directly using the same rules. Preserve trace IDs, span IDs,
parent IDs, timestamps, status, and semantic attributes under `extra.otel`.
Do not parse protobuf bytes, contact a collector, or ingest remote data in this
flow. If the export cannot establish parentage or a human instruction, record
no_candidate instead of guessing.

Before continuing, verify the canonical file has one ATIF v1.0-v1.7 object, one-based
sequential step IDs, at least one user step, and resolvable tool-call references.
The helper accepts at most 128 MiB of exact source bytes and produces canonical
and safe files of at most 25 MiB. It may make only two bounded normalizations:

- insert a missing JSON escape when the parser-implicated quote immediately
  follows a provider-redaction placeholder; and
- convert string-encoded ATIF image objects into image parts while omitting
  encoded binary data and oversized image metadata.

Every operation, offset, count, and loss is recorded in the canonical ATIF and
summary. Exact source bytes remain unchanged and hashed. Reject unrelated JSON
damage instead of repairing it heuristically.

## Step 3: make a text-only safe copy

```bash
python <skill_dir>/scripts/trace_environment.py prepare \
  --task-dir <task-dir> \
  --atif <canonical-atif-file> \
  --source-kind <atif|mlflow|intake|otel>
```

The helper retains an exact owner-private original, writes the bounded canonical
ATIF and a scrubbed safe copy, replaces image parts with omission markers, and
records only redaction counts in the safe report.
It recognizes common secret fields, bearer tokens, private keys, email addresses,
phone numbers, social-security numbers, IP addresses, internal Kubernetes hostnames,
and user home paths.

The helper also writes `private/privacy-audit.json`: a complete string-field and
character denominator, URL hosts, and candidate name, organization, and street
address findings. These are contextual leads, not automatic claims. Review every
text field in `safe/trace.atif.json`, every audit finding and host, then record
who performed this trace review. Generated task files do not exist yet; review
the complete publication separately after finalization.

```bash
python <skill_dir>/scripts/trace_environment.py review-privacy \
  --task-dir <task-dir> \
  --reviewer-kind <agent|human> \
  --note "<what was reviewed and any disposition>"
```

Never copy a redacted value into a verifier. An image-only user instruction is a
blocking reason and must remain no_candidate. The scanner cannot establish that
proprietary code is safe; the contextual reviewer owns that judgment.

## Step 4: inventory ground truth and software requirements

Before deciding candidacy, look for ground truth that is distinct from the
agent's observed answer:

- a separate reference or successful trajectory;
- expected output, golden files, fixtures, or labeled data;
- verifier inputs or reference solutions; and
- explicit human or evaluator feedback that establishes correctness.

An agent answer is not ground truth merely because the trace succeeded. Record
ground truth as `available`, `partial`, `absent`, or `unknown`. Retain available
artifacts under `private/ground-truth/`, make them owner-only, record their
SHA-256 digests, and declare whether each artifact came from an ATIF step or an
external source. ATIF provenance requires real step IDs and no external locator.
External provenance requires an empty step list and at least one immutable URI,
revision, or source ID. Never cite an instruction step as evidence for a public
benchmark fixture merely because both describe the same task. Record whether
ground truth is used for `comparison_only` or `verification`; use `none` when it
is absent or unknown. Do not copy private ground-truth values into the generated
task; generalize only what the verifier needs.

Also inventory software needed to reproduce the work or verify the outcome.
Include libraries and CLIs, desktop applications such as CAD tools, services,
hardware, and proprietary or commercially licensed software. For each item,
record whether it is actually required, its version when known, license class,
local availability, redistributability, evidence steps, and a short note.
Use the same explicit ATIF-or-external provenance object for software facts.

Inventory the complete build, runtime, solution, and verifier dependency
closure. Pin images, packages, repositories, and tools where reproducibility
depends on them. The grading path must not download dependencies or contact a
live service. A dependency needed only by the verifier still belongs in the
inventory; common misses include fonts, compiler headers, package indexes, and
language registries.

Do not silently replace required software with a different application or mock
when the requested behavior depends on the real product. Required unavailable
software prevents candidacy. Unknown availability keeps the environment
unproven until resolved. Proprietary or non-redistributable software is usable
only when a legitimate, reproducible runtime path exists; never copy licensed
binaries into the task.

## Step 5: decide candidate or no_candidate

Read only `safe/trace.atif.json`. Later user corrections outrank earlier turns.
Every decision must cite real ATIF `step_id` values. Write `candidate.json` with
this shape:

```json
{
  "schema": "nemo.eval_author.trace_environment_candidate.v2",
  "status": "candidate",
  "decision_basis": "safe_atif_only",
  "instruction": "Observable task instruction without private values",
  "requirements": [
    {"description": "Objectively testable requirement", "evidence_steps": [1, 2]}
  ],
  "verification_mode": "execution",
  "evidence_steps": [1, 2],
  "uncertainties": [],
  "reason_codes": [],
  "ground_truth": {
    "availability": "available",
    "use": "comparison_only",
    "artifacts": [
      {
        "kind": "expected_output",
        "path": "private/ground-truth/expected.json",
        "sha256": "sha256:<64-hex-digest>",
        "provenance": {
          "kind": "external",
          "step_ids": [],
          "uri": "https://example.test/fixture.json",
          "revision": "<immutable-revision>",
          "source_id": null
        },
        "notes": "Expected output attached to the recorded task."
      }
    ],
    "absence_reason": null
  },
  "software_requirements": [
    {
      "name": "ExampleCAD",
      "category": "desktop_application",
      "required": true,
      "version": "2026",
      "license": "proprietary",
      "availability": "unknown",
      "redistributable": false,
      "provenance": {
        "kind": "atif_step",
        "step_ids": [1, 2],
        "uri": null,
        "revision": null,
        "source_id": null
      },
      "notes": "The requested edit and verifier depend on native CAD behavior."
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `candidate` only when the request and expected outcome are complete,
reproducible without private or live external state, and objectively testable.
This basic flow supports execution verification only. Do not add a model judge
or convert a subjective, visual, or prose-quality outcome into a brittle string
check.

For no candidate, set `status` to `no_candidate`, `instruction` and
`verification_mode` to `null`, keep `requirements` empty, and include one or more
stable `reason_codes`. Keep the `ground_truth` and `software_requirements`
inventories in the record even when they are empty or explain the blocker.
Typical reasons are `missing_instruction`,
`missing_outcome`, `requires_private_state`, `requires_live_external_state`,
`non_text_evidence_required`, `subjective_verification`, and
`insufficient_trace_evidence`. Use `required_software_unavailable` or
`proprietary_runtime_unavailable` when the software inventory blocks a
reproducible task. Ground truth may be absent without blocking a task, but its
absence must be explicit.

For batch reporting, distinguish source and construction failures rather than
folding them into `insufficient_trace_evidence`: use `malformed_atif`,
`source_too_large`, `build_dependency_unavailable`,
`verifier_dependency_unavailable`, `network_dependency_required`, and
`verifier_not_isolated` where applicable. Record the concrete failed command or
contract check in `did_not_work`; keep `reason_codes` stable and aggregateable.

## Step 6: author and prove a candidate environment

Skip this step for no_candidate. Under `<task-dir>/task/`, create the smallest
Harbor task that reproduces the initial state and objectively verifies the
generalized outcome:

- `task.toml` with realistic timeouts and resources;
- `instruction.md` matching `candidate.json` without leaking tool names or test logic;
- `environment/` containing prerequisites but never the solution;
- `tests/test.sh` that grades only the observable outcome;
- `solution/solve.sh` with the reference solution; and
- `README.md` containing reviewer-facing development context, not a copy of the
  agent instruction.

`task.toml` must explicitly set `[verifier].environment_mode = "separate"`,
`[verifier].network_mode = "no-network"`, and a
`[verifier.environment]` table whose `network_mode` is also `"no-network"`.
The helper rejects shared verification because it lets the grader observe or
alter the agent container and can expose hidden tests to the agent. When the
grader needs a different image, provide a verifier-owned `tests/Dockerfile` or
a pinned verifier image through `[verifier.environment]`; include its complete
grading dependency closure and `/tests` tree.

For a multi-step task, every step inherits the top-level separate verifier.
An explicit `[steps.verifier]` override must not select `shared`. When a step
defines `[steps.verifier.environment]`, that environment must also set
`network_mode = "no-network"`. Transfer only the declared agent-produced
artifacts into the verifier environment; do not mount or copy the agent
workspace wholesale.

Read and follow `references/environment-integrity.md` for agent-network,
contamination, portability, repeat-run, and negative-control requirements.

```toml
[verifier]
environment_mode = "separate"
network_mode = "no-network"

[verifier.environment]
network_mode = "no-network"

[environment]
network_mode = "no-network"
```

Add a step-local environment only when that step needs a different verifier
image or resource configuration:

```toml
[[steps]]
name = "grade"

[steps.verifier]
environment_mode = "separate"

[steps.verifier.environment]
network_mode = "no-network"
```

The task README is not passed to the agent. Give it a level-one task title and
these substantive level-two sections:

- `Difficulty explanation`: why the task is difficult for agents and humans;
- `Environment and software requirements`: runtimes, services, hardware,
  versions, licensing, and availability constraints;
- `Ground-truth provenance`: what establishes correctness and where that
  evidence came from, without exposing private values;
- `Solution explanation`: the high-level reference approach without duplicating
  `solution/solve.sh`;
- `Verification explanation`: the observable outcomes and how the verifier
  distinguishes success from failure; and
- `Relevant experience`: human-supplied experience relevant to authoring or
  reviewing the task.

Keep each section concise and evidence-backed. Do not repeat `instruction.md`,
reveal verifier internals to the agent, or invent author experience. If a human
cannot supply and review `Relevant experience`, keep the environment `unproven`
rather than claiming it is ready.

Do not copy private trace payloads into the task. Include only the minimal files
needed to reproduce the starting state. Pin external source to an exact public
commit when it is truly required; otherwise prefer a small local fixture.

Before Harbor, record the exact task tree and its static integrity scan:

```bash
python <skill_dir>/scripts/trace_environment.py record-reproducibility \
  --task-dir <task-dir>
```

Run at least two independent NOP jobs, two Oracle jobs, and one task-specific
negative-control job. Record each run's inputs before Harbor creates its job
directory. Each invocation must create fresh task containers. For example:

```bash
python <skill_dir>/scripts/trace_environment.py record-run-inputs \
  --task-dir <task-dir> --arm nop --job-dir private/jobs/nop-1
harbor run -p <task-dir>/task -a nop \
  --jobs-dir <task-dir>/private/jobs --job-name nop-1
```

Repeat with `nop-2`, `oracle-1`, and `oracle-2`, selecting the matching arm and
agent. Follow the integrity reference to declare and run the negative control.
Retain every exact Harbor job and use the reference's `record-validation`
command. Never hand-write rewards, job IDs, exceptions, or checksums. Do not
weaken the verifier to make Oracle pass. Failed proof remains technical evidence.

If Harbor or Docker is missing, technical status is `not_run` and the environment
is `unproven`; do not describe it as ready. Two NOP=0 runs, two Oracle=1 runs,
and a task-specific negative-control=0 run without exceptions establish technical
status `passed` only when their recorded agents and task snapshots match. They
do not establish human review or container freshness. Reports distinguish
verified distinct job IDs/paths from `container_freshness: "unverified"`. The
helper independently requires the task configuration and every retained Harbor
result to report separate verification.

## Step 7: finalize and verify the summary

Record concise facts about the conversion and construction. Do not include raw
payloads or redacted values in these flags.

For a ready candidate:

```bash
python <skill_dir>/scripts/trace_environment.py finalize \
  --task-dir <task-dir> \
  --status candidate \
  --human-reviewed \
  --worked-well "<evidence-backed success>" \
  --did-not-work "<evidence-backed limitation>"
```

For no_candidate:

```bash
python <skill_dir>/scripts/trace_environment.py finalize \
  --task-dir <task-dir> \
  --status no_candidate \
  --reason "<why no reproducible environment can be built>"
```

Then verify digests and required artifacts:

```bash
python <skill_dir>/scripts/trace_environment.py check \
  --task-dir <task-dir>
```

The helper derives environment status rather than accepting a claimed status:
failed technical proof becomes `failed`; passed proof with the required separate
no-network verification, `--human-reviewed`, and no required software whose
availability is `unknown` becomes `ready`; every other
candidate is `unproven`. A shared verifier is a contract error rather than an
unproven candidate. The human-review flag means a human supplied or reviewed
Relevant experience and the generalized task. It is distinct from the earlier
contextual privacy review, which records either an agent or human reviewer.

## Batch and publication

For a multi-task run, write a checked-in manifest with stable task IDs and
source paths. This makes the denominator explicit and reruns idempotent:

```json
{
  "schema": "nemo.eval_author.trace_environment_batch.v1",
  "members": [
    {"task_id": "stable-id", "atif": "private-source.atif.json", "source_kind": "atif"}
  ]
}
```

Keep a real manifest's source paths private if they reveal internal layout.
Prepare missing members, safely resume existing ones, and report every member:

```bash
python <skill_dir>/scripts/trace_environment.py batch-prepare \
  --manifest <manifest.json>
python <skill_dir>/scripts/trace_environment.py batch-status \
  --manifest <manifest.json>
```

`denominator` must equal the selected source set. Never report only candidates
or successes. A malformed workspace remains in the `batch-status` report with
status `invalid` and makes the report invalid without hiding other member rows.

Before any export, including `no_candidate`, read and follow
`references/publication-review.md`. Prepare the complete private publication
preview, review every exported file and path, and attest its exact digest before
exporting. Trace privacy review and `--human-reviewed` do not replace this gate.
Any change to the public product requires a new publication review; a successful
`check` alone is not publication approval.

Report the task ID, `candidate` or `no_candidate`, ground-truth availability and
artifact count, required software and licensing constraints, environment
status, technical status, review status, verifier isolation, privacy review
status, NOP and Oracle rewards when run, and paths to
`summary.md` and the generated task. A `valid: true` check proves the recorded
files are internally consistent; Harbor is the authority for whether the task
actually runs.
