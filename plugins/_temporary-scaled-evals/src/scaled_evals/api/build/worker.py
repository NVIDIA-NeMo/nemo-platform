"""Task build job + status persistence — **approach-agnostic**.

Legacy synchronous build primitives. New finalize requests are persisted and
processed by :mod:`scaled_evals.api.build.queue_worker`; these functions remain
for compatibility with direct callers.

This layer is reused by EVERY build approach: it depends only on the contract
"produce `(image_ref, image_digest)` or raise". The actual build is delegated to
the current approach (`buildkit`); a future multi-backend setup would select the
backend at that one call site. Everything else here — the job wrapper and the
`ready`/`failed` status writes — is shared. See docs/internals/ARCHITECTURE.md § Container
Build.

    task's current revision; on failure it flips to `failed` with the
