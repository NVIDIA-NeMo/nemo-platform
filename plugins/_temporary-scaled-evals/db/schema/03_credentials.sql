-- See docs/API.md sections "Credentials (BYOK)", "Tenancy", "Identifiers".

-- provider is the single category and states what the secret is for: the

-- supplied as a `yaml` blob); 'openshift' is a user's OpenShift bearer token
-- (a `key`) that dispatch turns into a per-eval kubeconfig so the run acts as
-- that user. Callers already know this mapping, so there is no separate `type`
-- column.
