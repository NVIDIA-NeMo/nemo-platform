# Safe Synthesizer

Task router for agents helping a person use the NeMo Safe Synthesizer NMP plugin. Read the task file that matches the user request before giving user-facing instructions.

## Prerequisites

- The NeMo Safe Synthesizer plugin is installed in the active NeMo Platform environment.
- Platform jobs require workspace access to the input fileset and any `hf_token_secret` or PII classification provider.
- Container jobs require a GPU-capable Jobs backend and access to the configured Safe Synthesizer task image.
- Fileset references use `<workspace>/<fileset>#<path>` unless a workflow states otherwise.

## Route

- Create platform container jobs: read `workflows/run.md`.
- Set or override job parameters: read `workflows/config.md`.
- Diagnose runtime, install, generation, OOM, validation, or fileset failures: read `workflows/diagnose.md`.
- Retrieve job result artifacts: read `workflows/results.md`.
- Interpret outputs, logs, synthetic data, reports, summaries, or adapters: read `workflows/artifacts.md`.

## Plugin-Specific Rules

- Use platform container jobs for Safe Synthesizer usage.
- Use `nemo safe-synthesizer generate`, the Jobs API, or the SDK for Safe Synthesizer jobs.
- Configure released container jobs with `NMP_IMAGE_REGISTRY=nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-platform`, `NMP_IMAGE_TAG=<tag>`, and `NEMO_SAFE_SYNTHESIZER_CONTAINER_IMAGE=safe-synthesizer-tasks`.
- Override local task images with `NEMO_SAFE_SYNTHESIZER_CONTAINER_IMAGE_REF=<image-ref>`; this bypasses platform registry/tag qualification.
- Treat `data_source` as a fileset URL for platform jobs, usually `<workspace>/<fileset>#<path>`.
- If the job uses PII classification, `config.replace_pii.globals.classify.classify_model_provider` must be `<workspace>/<provider_name>`.
- Keep usage guidance separate from plugin source development internals unless the user asks to change the plugin.

## Answer Contract

- Start with the direct command, diagnosis, or file path.
- Cite relevant repo docs paths when useful, especially `plugins/nemo-safe-synthesizer/README.md` and `docs/safe-synthesizer/getting-started.mdx`.
- Include one concrete next action unless the user asks for a full walkthrough.
- If the user asks to change CLI, config, job compilation, or task source code, inspect the plugin code before answering.

## Next Steps

- Start usage from `plugins/nemo-safe-synthesizer/README.md`.
- For product docs, use `docs/safe-synthesizer/getting-started.mdx`.
- For commands, read `workflows/run.md`.
- For configuration, read `workflows/config.md`, then `workflows/config-runs.md` for examples.
- For failures, read `workflows/diagnose.md`.
- For outputs, read `workflows/results.md` and `workflows/artifacts.md`.
