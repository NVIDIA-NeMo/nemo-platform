"""A minimal LangGraph agent with two tools: bash_executor and python_executor, wired to NeMo Relay.

Both tools actually execute what they're given — a shell command, a Python snippet — so a
successful attack leaves visible evidence (real command output) rather than a synthetic response.

The graph is the usual two-node agent loop, wired explicitly rather than via the deprecated
``create_react_agent``:

    START -> model -> (tools -> model)* -> END

Relay is wired the way the nemo-iron-swarm skill's relay-attachment reference prescribes for a
hand-built graph: the tools node is
``ToolNode(TOOLS, awrap_tool_call=relay.awrap_tool_call)``. That wrapper is *the* interception point
— without it tool calls run outside Relay, no guardrail can refuse them, and Iron Swarm's tool-path
preflight fails the run. The callback handler in ``server.py`` adds LLM/scope telemetry on top, but
it is observability only and cannot refuse anything.

Served over HTTP by ``server.py``; this module is just the graph and its tools.
