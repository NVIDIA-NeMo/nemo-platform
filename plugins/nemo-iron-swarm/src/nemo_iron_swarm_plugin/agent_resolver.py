"""Resolve a deployed NeMo Platform agent into an Iron Swarm manifest.

This is the centerpiece that makes ``nemo iron-swarm init`` trivial: instead of pointing
iron-swarm at a NAT project and answering discovery prompts, the user names an agent already
deployed in NeMo Platform and we derive the manifest from the agent registry.

Design constraints (both deliberate):

- **No ``iron_swarm`` import.** iron-swarm runs from its own venv, driven by subprocess: its
  garak-based attacker pulls a dependency closure (``litellm``/``torch``) that conflicts with the
  platform's, so it stays out of our lockfile. We therefore build the manifest *dict* matching
  iron-swarm's ``AgentManifest``/``AgentSpec`` schema and let ``iron-swarm run`` validate it. The
  schema authority is ``iron_swarm/manifest.py`` (``AgentSpec`` fields: name, project_dir,
  workflow, port, secrets, secrets_file, egress).
- **Read the agent over HTTP.** We fetch it via the platform SDK (``client.agents.get`` /
  ``client.agents.deployments.list``), which returns plain dicts, so resolution needs no
  ``nemo_agents_plugin`` entity classes. The ~10-line IGW injection below is a local copy of
  ``nemo_agents_plugin.utils.inject_gateway_url``. That copy originally existed to avoid a
  cross-plugin dependency; that rationale is obsolete (``nemo-agents-plugin`` is now a declared
  dependency and ``api/v2/runs.py`` imports ``Agent`` from it), so the copy is free to drift from
  upstream — it has already grown a ``model_override`` parameter the original lacks.

Models resolve through the Inference Gateway (the platform standard): the victim workflow's
OpenAI/NIM LLMs get the IGW ``base_url`` injected, so no raw model keys are needed.
