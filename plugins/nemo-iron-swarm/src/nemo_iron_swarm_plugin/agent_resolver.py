"""Turn a registered NeMo Platform agent into a runnable Iron Swarm victim.

This is the only intake path. The user names an agent already registered in the platform and the
plugin hands Iron Swarm a directory containing a runnable agent — a config plus the Dockerfile that
serves it — rather than a query Iron Swarm has to re-evaluate.

Two constraints shape it:

- **All ``nemo-agents-spec-v1`` knowledge lives here.** Iron Swarm's contract is "a directory with
  an agent in it", so it never learns the platform's config format. It also cannot: reading the spec
  means importing ``nemo-agents-plugin``, which pins six ``nvidia-nat-*`` distributions that
  iron-swarm exists to be free of.
- **No ``iron_swarm`` import.** iron-swarm runs from its own venv, driven by subprocess: its
  garak-based attacker pulls a dependency closure (``litellm``/``torch``) that conflicts with the
  platform's. We build the manifest *dict* matching iron-swarm's ``AgentSpec`` schema and let
  ``iron-swarm run`` validate it. The schema authority is ``iron_swarm/manifest.py``.

The image is not hand-rolled. ``render_fabric_dockerfile(..., sandbox_runtime="openshell")`` is the
platform's own Fabric packaging pipeline, and the ``openshell`` sandbox profile already bakes in
exactly what Iron Swarm's sandbox requires — a non-root ``sandbox`` user, ``iproute2`` and
``nftables`` — so the agent under test is packaged the same way a deployed one is.
