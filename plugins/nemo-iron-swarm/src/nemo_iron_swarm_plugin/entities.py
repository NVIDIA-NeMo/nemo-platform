"""Entity definitions for the Iron Swarm plugin — stored in the NeMo Platform entity store.

A :class:`IronSwarmRun` records one war-game run (agent targeted, victim port, manifest, outcome); a
:class:`IronSwarmManifest` is a named, reusable war-game target scaffolded from a deployed agent or an
uploaded NAT project. ``name``/``workspace``/``created_at``/``id`` are inherited from the base and
managed by the store; only domain fields are declared here. The ``IRON_SWARM_*_TYPE`` constants are
the canonical entity-type strings used at every call site.
