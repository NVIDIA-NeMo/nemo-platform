"""Download + safely expand an uploaded NAT project bundle stored as a platform fileset.

An uploaded project is stored as a single-file fileset (one zip). The inspect endpoint, manifest
creation, and the war-game job all need the project on local disk, so this module downloads the whole
fileset and expands the zip with hardening (no absolute members, no symlinks, no traversal, bounded
size/entry count) — the archive is untrusted user input and is never executed here (only statically
scanned by ``iron-swarm inspect`` and later run inside the OpenShell sandbox).
