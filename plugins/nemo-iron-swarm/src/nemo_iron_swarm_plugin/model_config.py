"""User-selectable model configuration for a war-game.

Iron Swarm's model-driven roles collapse into three user-facing groups:

- ``attack``   — garak's red-team + detector models (the adversary).
- ``analysis`` — the defenders + the benign validator (both its synth suite-generation and its judge)
  — one shared "analysis" model.
- ``safety``   — the guardrail middleware the guardrails defender installs on the victim.

The victim's own LLM is deliberately *not* a group. In NAT it is declared in the workflow YAML, so
overriding it would mean rewriting the target's own config — the war-game measures the agent rather
than editing it. Change it in the project's workflow and re-upload.

``attack`` and ``analysis`` reach iron-swarm as subprocess env vars; ``safety`` travels in the
manifest instead (``overrides.defenders`` → the guardrails entry's ``config``), because it is consumed
by a defender rather than by the iron-swarm process.

Each group is a :class:`ModelChoice` (model name, optional custom ``base_url``, optional Secrets
name for a custom provider key). ``None`` anywhere means "use the built-in default", so an unset
config reproduces today's behavior exactly.

This module is the single source of truth shared by the entity (stored default), the job spec
(per-run override), and the API (the defaults the UI pre-fills). It imports nothing plugin-internal
so it can be depended on from anywhere without cycles.
