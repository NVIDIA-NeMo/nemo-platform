"""Compose a chosen subset of a run's recommended defenses into deployable workflow + policy YAML.

A hardening run's ``mitigations`` artifact enumerates each individually selectable defense in
``defenses[]`` (one per ``custom_guardrail_N`` middleware plus, optionally, the hardened OpenShell
policy). The Studio "harden" flow lets the user pick a subset; this rebuilds the workflow with only the
selected guardrails and picks the hardened-vs-baseline policy, so the selection can be previewed, frozen
into a sanity-check run, and applied. Guardrails are structurally independent (a keyed global middleware
entry + a name in the attacked tool's ``middleware`` list), so dropping one is a clean delete.
