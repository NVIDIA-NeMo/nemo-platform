"""Classified war-game failures + the classifiers the run boundary uses.

Every failure that can affect a run's results is reduced to a :class:`RunFailure` — a stable
``category`` plus an operator-facing ``message`` and ``remediation`` — so :meth:`IronSwarmRunJob.run`
records the *cause* on every channel the user sees (the run record, the platform job's
``error_details``) instead of a bare "exited with code 1". Failures raise :class:`IronSwarmRunError`
at their source (subclass of ``RuntimeError`` so existing ``pytest.raises(RuntimeError)`` still hold);
anything else reaching the boundary is classified by :func:`classify_exception`. Subprocess failures
are classified from iron-swarm's own ``run-error.json`` (:func:`read_run_error`), falling back to the
exit code + log tail.
