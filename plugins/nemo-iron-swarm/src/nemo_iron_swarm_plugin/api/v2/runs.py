"""Read-only routes over the ``IronSwarmRun`` entity.

Mounted by the plugin service at ``/apis/iron-swarm/v2/workspaces/{workspace}``. War-game
runs are created by the job (``client.entities.create``), so the plugin only exposes reads:
list the agent's runs (Studio's Hardening tab) and fetch one. The entity is the same shape
on the wire as at rest, so it is returned directly.
