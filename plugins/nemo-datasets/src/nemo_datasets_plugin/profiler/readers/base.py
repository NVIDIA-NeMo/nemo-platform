"""Per-format reader contract and registry.

Each reader is a stateless handler for one on-disk format, safe to reuse across files. Readers are
looked up by ``file_format`` (from :func:`detect_format`) so the pipeline never branches on format
itself. Built-in readers self-register (a ``register_reader`` call at the bottom of each module) and
are loaded lazily on the first :func:`get_reader` call, so importing this module does not pull in
pyarrow until a reader is actually needed.
