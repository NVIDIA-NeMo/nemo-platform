"""Split resolution from file paths.

Given the files in one partition, group them into splits by inferring each file's split from its
path — a split-named directory first, then the shard-stripped filename. A declared split map from a
dataset card would take precedence over this inference, but card parsing is not wired up yet, so
path inference is the only source today.
