"""Classification: assign column roles, resolve the format/prompt-form axes, and pick a dataset type.

Roles are inferred from column names, gated by dtype, and stacked onto the feature nodes as
``semantic_role`` markers. The dataset type is the most specific structure the assigned roles
satisfy.

Content probes are measured in :mod:`stats` over every column; this module only interprets the
counts. Roles order that interpretation -- a column known to be the ground truth beats one that
merely looks like it -- but do not gate it, so a dataset with unrecognized column names keeps
whatever its content proves.
