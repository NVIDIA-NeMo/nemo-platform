"""Dataset-profiler task.

Runs as a platform job: it reads a step config naming what to profile, runs the profiler, and
publishes the resulting ``DatasetProfile`` as a job result artifact named ``profile``
(``profile.json``).

This is deliberately *not* a ``nemo`` CLI subcommand. The profiler is new enough that its inputs and
its output contract are both still moving, and a published subcommand is a promise to keep them
still. A task module is invoked by the platform and by tests, which is the whole audience today.

Only a local directory is profiled here. Reading a platform fileset through ranged requests, and
storing the profile back onto that fileset, both need Files-service surface this plugin does not
depend on; they arrive with the Files integration and change only :func:`_build_source` and the
publish step. The profiler core stays blind to where its bytes come from — that is what the
``FileSource`` seam is for.
