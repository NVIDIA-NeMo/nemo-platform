"""Build and generate an OpenShell ``SandboxPolicy`` proto.

Two producers, one proto:

- ``load_sandbox_policy`` reads a hand-written policy YAML.
- ``generate_sandbox_policy`` builds a default-deny policy structurally from a
  sandbox's own filesystem shape + the platform egress it must reach.

Both go through ``build_sandbox_policy`` so the mapping from the documented YAML
shape (``version`` / ``filesystem_policy`` / ``landlock`` / ``process`` /
``network_policies``) to the proto lives in one place. Everything here is a
property of the *sandbox*, not of a deployment: it takes plain structured inputs
and returns a policy, so a future non-deployment consumer (a sandboxed job, a
tool runner) can reuse it without importing deployment types.
