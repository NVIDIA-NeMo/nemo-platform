"""OpenShell sandbox image profile.

Registered under the ``nemo.sandbox_profiles`` entry-point group so
``nemo agents package --sandbox-runtime openshell`` can bake OpenShell's
supervisor requirements into an agent image without the packager importing
anything OpenShell-specific.

Intentionally dependency-light (no gRPC / client imports) so profile discovery
works even when the ``nemo-deployments[openshell]`` extra is not installed.
