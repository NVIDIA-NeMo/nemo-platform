"""Analyst CLI — ``nemo agents analyst ...`` subcommands.

Registered under ``nemo.cli.agents`` and mounted by ``AgentsCLI`` as
``nemo agents analyst <verb>``. Verb bodies live as module-level callbacks in
``nemo_insights_plugin.cli`` so the analyst implementation stays in one place.
Periodic-analysis and job surfaces stay on ``nemo insights``: they manage the
plugin's scheduled runs rather than driving the analyst itself.
