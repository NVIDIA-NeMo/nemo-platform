"""The Insights Analyst's agent definition, built per request.

The Analyst's config is derived, not authored: its models are chosen by the
caller and its harness settings are scoped to a single run, so there is nothing
durable to store. Building it here keeps the one part that *is* fixed — the
Fabric adapter and the shape of its settings — next to the adapter it pairs
with, and lets ``agents.execute`` take it as an inline definition rather than an
Agent entity somebody has to provision and keep current.
