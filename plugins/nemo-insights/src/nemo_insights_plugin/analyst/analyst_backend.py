"""Data-access backend for the analyst's tools and final change-set.

Every tool talks to the platform through one :class:`AnalystBackend`, built
once per run by the CLI and shared via ``AnalystDeps`` instead of threading a
raw SDK client around. The backend owns the SDK client and exposes:

- read-only Intake queries (spans, span groups, feedback annotations, and a
  span-rollup session count),
- ``list_insights`` so the analyst can see what already exists, and
- ``persist_result``: the single write entry point that takes the analyst's
  :class:`~nemo_insights_plugin.analyst.result.AnalystResult` and stores it.

Intake reads (spans, span groups, annotations, session count) always hit the
live platform.

Insights always go to the platform. :class:`RemoteAnalystBackend` lists them via
the plugin API and persists the result as Insight rows through it. Given an
:class:`InsightsFileStore`, it then mirrors what the platform stored — platform
ids included — into a local YAML file (``--insights-file-output``), so the two
stores speak the same identifiers and a later run's updates land in both. The
platform is the source of truth: it is written first and the file follows, and a
file that cannot be written degrades to a warning on the run report rather than
failing a run whose platform writes already succeeded.

:class:`LocalAnalystBackend` never touches the plugin API, listing from and
persisting to the file alone. It is **maintainer tooling, not a user-facing
mode**: the insights evaluation treats the YAML as the artifact under test and runs
against subjects that expose Intake but not the Insights plugin (see
``evaluation/README.md``). There is no CLI flag for it; only ``make_analyst_backend``'s
``local_only`` argument selects it.

:func:`make_analyst_backend` picks one. The client's lifecycle is owned by the
caller (the CLI), so the backend never closes it.

    """Persist the analyst's result to a local YAML file only.

    Maintainer tooling for the insights evaluation, not a user-facing mode — no CLI
    flag reaches it. The evaluation treats the YAML as the artifact under test
    (checked in, hashed, diffed across runs) and analyzes subjects that expose
    Intake but not the Insights plugin, so its runs must neither require nor
    touch platform Insight rows.

    Reads of traces/spans/annotations still hit the live platform, but insights
    are both listed from and written to the file. Ids are minted locally, so a
    file written this way is an independent store rather than a mirror of
    platform rows.

    The file accumulates across runs — ``persist_result`` merges the new
    change-set into whatever the file already holds rather than overwriting it,
    so re-running the analyst against the same file folds new evidence into
    existing insights instead of dropping prior work.

    File shape: ``{"insights": [<Insight record>, ...]}`` — each record is the
    stored entity.
