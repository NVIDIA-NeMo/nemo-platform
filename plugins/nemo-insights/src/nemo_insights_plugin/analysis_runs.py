"""High-level Insights analysis-run request helpers.

This module is a thin facade over the generic ``agents.execute`` job. The
current ``AnalyzeJob`` can continue to run side-by-side while this path
exercises the Analyst-as-Agent implementation.

Insights persists one :class:`~nemo_insights_plugin.entities.AnalysisRun` per
run, holding only what the Jobs layer cannot know: that a job was an analysis
run, and over which agent and scope. Execution state is *not* copied — it is
read back from the job on demand.

The run is named before the job is submitted and the job takes that same name,
so the two are linked by construction rather than by a write-back. That is what
makes the failure modes distinguishable: a run whose job 404s never landed, and
a resubmission that conflicts is proof the original did.
