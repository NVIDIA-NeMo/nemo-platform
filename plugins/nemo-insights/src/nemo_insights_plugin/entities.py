    and its job is *derivable* rather than written back after the fact. That
    removes the dual write, and with it the failure mode where a job exists
    that no run points at: a run whose job name 404s simply never landed. There
    is no resubmit-under-an-existing-name route yet, so such a run is a read
    today, not something a caller can drive back to completion.

    Progress is deliberately absent. Status, logs, and results belong to the
    Job and are read from it; mirroring them here would go stale immediately.
    Insights owns only what no lower layer knows: that this job was an analysis
    run, over which agent and scope.
