# NeMo Analyst

Analyze an agent's behavior from its own telemetry and record what recurs as
Insights.

## What it produces

An Insight is a persistent, named description of one recurring problem, and it
is the unit of work the rest of the optimization loop runs on. Each carries:

- `title` — a sentence naming the failure, such as "Retrieval drops relevant
  context near the token limit"
- `description` — the failure mode, the tool or model call it affects, and the
  conditions that trigger it
- `trace_refs` — the Intake trace IDs cited as evidence, so a developer can
  audit the reasoning and build regression tests

The Analyst targets at least three representative traces per Insight and appends
evidence to an existing Insight rather than filing a near-duplicate. It judges
behavior rather than status or scores, so it finds failures in sessions that
reported success and passed their evaluations. Two well-evidenced Insights are
worth more than ten vague ones, so a run that files nothing is a valid outcome.

## Before running

The Analyst reads telemetry; it cannot create it. Confirm all three:

- The target agent already has traces in Intake. No traces means no Insights.
- The platform is reachable at `NMP_BASE_URL`.
- The Analyst has a model to run on. It is an LLM agent itself, and how that is
  configured is changing, so let pre-flight tell you whether it is satisfied —
  it names what is missing and how to set it. Don't reach for the
  Experimentalist's configuration; that is a different contract.

An `AGENT-SPEC.md` is optional but makes the Analyst materially better. It
carries the intent behind the agent — what it is for, its constraints, what
counts as success — none of which is recoverable from code or traces, so
without it the Analyst can only judge an agent against itself.

## Pre-flight

```bash
nemo agents analyst doctor
```

Only two results block a run: no usable model configured, and an
`optimizer.yaml` that is missing or unparseable — the second only if you intend
to run without `--agent`. Doctor takes no `--agent` flag, so it always checks
for a profile and always reports a red line when there is none; when you pass
`--agent`, that line is noise. Platform reachability and the workspace probe
only ever warn.

## Run it

```bash
nemo agents analyst run --agent <agent-name> --workspace <workspace>
```

Add `--agent-spec AGENT-SPEC.md` to tell it what the agent is supposed to do,
and `--verbose` to stream its tool calls and reasoning to stderr. Expect several
minutes; it surveys many sessions before drilling into any of them.

From an agent directory, an `optimizer.yaml` profile supplies `agent`,
`workspace`, and `agent_spec`, so the flags above become optional:

```bash
nemo agents analyst run
```

The profile is discovered by walking up from the current directory. Only those
three fields are read from it; other keys belong to the Experimentalist and are
ignored.

## Where Insights are stored

Insights always go to the platform. `--insights-file-output` additionally
mirrors what the platform stored, platform IDs included, merging into that file
on each run; a mirror that cannot be written warns rather than failing the run.

```bash
nemo agents analyst run --agent <agent-name> --insights-file-output .nemo-optimizer/insights.yaml
```

That path is what the Experimentalist reads by default, so it is the
conventional choice when handing off locally.

## Verify

Do not report success without checking that Insights actually landed. There is
no CLI verb for this yet, so read the Insights API directly:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(nemo auth token)" \
  "$NMP_BASE_URL/apis/insights/v2/workspaces/<workspace>/insights?agent=<agent-name>&page=1&page_size=20"
```

On a local platform with authentication disabled, `nemo auth token` fails and
the header can be dropped. A successful run leaves at least one Insight for the
agent, each with a clear title, an actionable description, and non-empty
`trace_refs`; stored Insights also appear in Studio's optimizer view for the
workspace.

## When it finds nothing

Besides a real "nothing worth filing", three things produce an empty result.
Scoping: the Analyst reads only what `--agent` and `--workspace` together
select, and `agent_name` is carried on agent-level spans, not on their model and
tool children. Volume: too few traces looks the same as a healthy agent. And
telemetry that captures only the shape of a run, spans without the inputs and
outputs, leaves nothing to judge however many spans there are.

## Hand off

Once an Insight exists, the Experimentalist acts on it:

```bash
nemo agents experimentalist run
```
