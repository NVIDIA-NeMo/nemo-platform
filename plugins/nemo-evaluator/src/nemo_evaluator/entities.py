"""Stored entities for the evaluator plugin (metrics and agent-eval tasks).

A :class:`MetricBundleEntity` is the persisted, queryable index for a metric.
The full executable :class:`~nemo_evaluator.shared.metric_bundles.bundles.MetricBundle`
(including its potentially multi-MiB serialized payload) lives in the Files
service; the entity stores only the lightweight, searchable projection plus a

back at the canonical copy.

A :class:`TaskEntity` is the persisted form of an agent-eval task — the SDK
:class:`~nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.tasks.AgentEvalTask`, addressed by
``workspace/name`` (the task's stable id is the record name) and reusable across runs.

# --- Eval result entities ----------------------------------------------------
#
# A result entity is the persisted, *queryable* record of one eval run: the
# aggregated scores plus the traits you'd filter on (target, dataset). The
# detailed per-row / per-trial output that doesn't fit a concise record stays in
# the run's fileset bundle, referenced here by ``bundle_ref``. The entity — not
# Intake — is the evaluator's source of truth; Intake is a denormalized, optional
# downstream copy.
#
# Both result types share the SAME record (``_EvalResultCommon``): provenance, the target it ran
# against, the aggregated ``scores`` rollup, and a ``bundle_ref`` to the full detail. They differ
# only where the domain genuinely differs — row-eval has *referenceable inputs* (its dataset fileset
# + metric refs), which the entity records; agent-eval's tasks are inline, so it has no input ref yet
# (the "Taskset" gap). Run counts / per-metric coverage are derivable rollups that live in the
# bundle's summary, not on the record. This keeps the two entities aligned and matches the lean legacy
# ``BaseJobResult`` → ``MetricJobResult`` / ``BenchmarkJobResult`` shape (refs + scores).

    Every field is required — a result is only persisted once the run has produced all of it, so the
    caller populates each value (no schema defaults papering over missing data). "What it ran
    against" is denormalized into flat ``target_*`` fields so the list route can filter by them (the
    entity filter matches top-level fields; a nested object wouldn't filter cleanly); they're nullable
    because an offline run (precomputed trials) has no target, but the caller must still pass them.

    (``labels`` and a run ``status`` are intentionally absent: there's no labels source on the spec
    yet, and persistence happens only on success — both would be schema defaults with no real data.

# --- Revisions ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A revision is an immutable snapshot of a task's or taskset's content, addressed by a digest of
# that content (see ``nemo_evaluator.content_hash``). Revisions exist so a reference can be *pinned*
# — ``workspace/task-name#<digest>`` resolves to exactly the content that was published, and a
# consumer re-derives the digest on read to confirm it.
#
# Persistence shape. A revision is a **child entity** of the record it snapshots, so entity-store
# parent-scoped uniqueness — unique within ``(workspace, entity_type, parent, name)`` — makes an
# ordinal collide rather than silently duplicate. Allocation of the next ordinal rides on the
# parent's ``db_version`` optimistic lock: bump ``latest_revision`` on the parent, and a concurrent
# publisher that raced loses with a conflict and retries.
#
# Naming. Revisions are named ``rev.<n>``, NOT by their digest. Entity names are capped at 63 chars
# and must start with a lowercase letter (``entity_naming.NAME_PATTERN``); a full 64-char hex digest
# violates both. Truncating it to fit — as derived metric names do — would shrink the collision
# bound for no benefit here, since a ref carries the digest in its ``#`` fragment (governed by the
# ref pattern, not the entity-name rules) and the digest lives on the record as an ordinary field
# with no length pressure. Resolving a pinned ref is a filtered lookup on ``content_hash`` scoped to
# the parent. As a bonus, ``rev.7`` is legible in a log line in a way a hex string is not.
#
# Head vs history. The parent record keeps its content fields as the *head* — the current version —
# and revisions accumulate alongside. This keeps the change additive: existing stored records stay
# valid, ``get_task`` and the ``Task`` DTO are unchanged, and nothing needs migrating. The cost is a
# denormalized copy: head and its corresponding revision can drift if a write fails between the two
# (there is no cross-entity transaction). Publishing reconciles — it hashes the head and creates the
# revision only if no revision carries that digest — so a torn write self-heals on the next publish
# rather than persisting a lie.
