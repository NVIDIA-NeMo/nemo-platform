"""Adapt a dataset-driven (row) evaluation result into the shape ``publish_to_intake`` consumes.

Row evaluation and agent evaluation converge at the Intake boundary: a published trajectory is a
single step carrying the final output text (see ``mapping.trial_to_atif_ingest``), and a row's
``sample`` is already ``{"output_text": ..., "response": ...}`` — the field names of ``AgentOutput``.
So rather than a second mapping and a second publish loop, a row result is adapted to an
``AgentEvalResult`` and goes through the same publisher, inheriting its idempotency guarantees.

The row vocabulary maps as: one row -> one trial, one (row, metric key) -> one score. A row's
test case identity is its content hash by default, so repeated rows become repeated trials of a
single test case — which is what the trial/task split already expresses.
