"""Boundary mapping: Evaluator vocabulary -> Intake/Experiments wire shapes.

This is the single place where Evaluator domain objects (``AgentEvalTrial``,
``AgentEvalTaskScore``, ``MetricOutput``) become the request bodies Intake and
the Experiments API expect. The Intake write-adapter tickets (D3/D4/D5) obtain
their request shapes and field names *only* from here, so a later rename is a
one-file change.

Design constraints (see AALGO-289):

* **Pure.** Every function reads SDK types and returns request params. No HTTP,
  no platform client, no imports from the Intake *service* (``nmp.intake.*``).
* **Typed at the boundary.** The returned values are the generated platform
  SDK's ``TypedDict`` params (``AtifCreateParams`` / ``EvaluatorResultCreateParams``).
  At runtime they are plain dicts the adapter splats into the client
  (``client.intake.ingest.atif.create(**body)``); statically, ``ty`` checks our
  field names, literals, and nested shapes against the real generated schema, so
  an API change that regenerates the SDK surfaces here as a type error instead of
  drifting silently. We depend on the client SDK (already a plugin dependency),
  never on the Intake service package.
* The well-known evidence-key constants (``initial_state``/``trace``/``logs``/
  ``final_state``/``verifier_logs``) belong with the SDK evidence work (D1,
  AALGO-281). Until D1 lands, this module references them as string literals so
  it stays unblocked.
