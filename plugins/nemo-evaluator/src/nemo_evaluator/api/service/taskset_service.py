"""CRUD service for persisted taskset entities.

A taskset is a flexible grouping of stored tasks: it holds references to its members
(``workspace/name``) plus free-form annotations, stored whole in the entity store. Stored
``TasksetEntity`` rows are mapped to the :class:`Taskset` API DTO — the same DTO/entity split
``TaskService`` uses — so the wire contract round-trips cleanly (an ``EntityBase``'s ``id``/
``created_at`` are computed and don't deserialize from the entity's own serialized form).

Unlike ``TaskService`` there are no inline members to normalize. Instead, every member reference is
resolved on write to the exact revision digest it names, which is also where a missing member is
caught — resolution has to fetch the task anyway, so existence falls out of it rather than costing
a separate round trip per member.
