"""CRUD service for persisted agent-eval task entities.

A task is stored whole in the entity store (its metrics — inline bundles and/or stored-metric refs —
live in the entity record; there's no separate Files payload, unlike a metric bundle). Stored
``TaskEntity`` rows are mapped to the :class:`Task` API DTO — like ``MetricService`` maps
``MetricBundleEntity`` to ``Metric`` — so the wire contract round-trips cleanly (an ``EntityBase``'s
``id``/``created_at`` are computed and don't deserialize from the entity's own serialized form).
