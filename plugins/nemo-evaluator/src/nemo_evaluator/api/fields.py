"""Shared field types for the evaluator API: entity references and metric payloads.

Split out of :mod:`nemo_evaluator.api.schemas` so the per-kind task definitions can use these
without importing the module that composes them into DTOs — the definitions are imported *by*
``schemas``, so they cannot import from it.

What counts as a ``workspace/name`` reference is **not** decided here: the shape
(:data:`~nemo_platform_plugin.refs.ENTITY_REF_PATTERN`) and the parser
(:func:`~nemo_platform_plugin.refs.parse_entity_ref`) are the platform's, shared with every other
plugin. This module only adds what is specific to a *revisioned* evaluator entity — the ``#fragment``
that selects a revision.

Everything here is re-exported from ``schemas`` for callers that already import it from there.
