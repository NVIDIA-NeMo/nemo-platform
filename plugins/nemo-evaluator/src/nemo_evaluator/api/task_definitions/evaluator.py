    """What the agent should do, and how the platform scores it.

    ``metrics`` accepts inline bundles on the way in and holds references once stored: the service
    offloads an inline metric to a content-addressed *derived* metric on create, so a persisted task
    only ever names metrics it does not own. That narrowing is a service invariant rather than a
    type-level one — a single model keeps the API surface small, at the cost of this field being
    wider than what a stored task actually contains.

    Every field here is covered by the revision digest, ``reference`` included: it decides what a
    metric grades against, so two revisions that score differently must not share a digest. Pinning
    a revision therefore fixes the grading, not just the prompt.
