    """A reference to the task's packaged files, plus a projection of Harbor's own config.

    Harbor identifies a task by a *directory* — ``task.toml``, an instruction, an environment — so
    what is stored is a reference to that directory's archive in the Files service, not the files
    themselves. One fileset per task, so a task shared by several tasksets is stored once. The
    archive is materialized back into ``<dir>/<task-name>/`` at run time, which is the layout
    Harbor's own discovery expects.

    Which agent runs the task is *not* stored here. That comes from the run's target
    (``HarborRunnerTarget``), so the same stored task can be evaluated against different agents.
    Harbor's own ``[agent]`` block — carried inside ``config`` — configures how the agent *phase*
    runs (timeout, user, network policy), not which agent it is.
