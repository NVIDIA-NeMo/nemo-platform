"""Describe a live agent runner as the target spec that reproduces it job-side.

The SDK's runners are Python objects built for the process they run in; the plugin's targets are
wire DTOs built to survive being sent somewhere else. This module is the one-way bridge: take a
runner someone got working locally with ``AgentEvaluator().run()``, and produce the spec that runs
the same evaluation as a governed job — without asking them to retype its configuration and get it
subtly wrong.

**One-way on purpose.** The reverse direction (spec to runner) already exists in
:mod:`nemo_evaluator.jobs.agent_evaluate`, where the job resolves its own target and can inject the
runtime-only values a spec has no business carrying — the way Harbor's ``jobs_dir`` comes from the
job's storage. Keeping construction there and description here means neither side has to know the
other's local details.

**Refuses rather than quietly drops.** A runner can hold state with no wire form: a callable, a
handle to something in this process, a path that means nothing on another machine. Silently
dropping it would submit a job that runs something *different* from what was tested locally, which
is worse than not submitting at all. Those cases raise :class:`UnsubmittableRunnerError` naming what
could not travel.

Only :class:`GymAgentTaskRunner` is supported today. The other shipped runners each need their own
decisions about what survives translation, and are deliberately not guessed at here.

    Every field carries, and nothing is rejected — unusual among the runners, and worth saying
    plainly rather than inventing rejections to look careful. Gym's settings are all *behaviour*
    (which environment, which agent, how many attempts, how long to wait) rather than *location*:
    there is no work root, no local base directory, and no injected callable to lose. The one thing
    that reads like a local path, ``agent_config``, is resolved relative to the Gym installation
    rather than the caller's filesystem, and the job container is required to have Gym installed
    regardless.

    ``env_vars`` carries verbatim, including absolute paths. A value like a model-cache root may
    well be wrong job-side — but a container path is absolute too, so nothing here can tell a local
    path from one that is correct in the job's image, and guessing would break the legitimate case
    to protect against a mistake the submitter is better placed to catch.

    The one rejection is a value with no JSON form. ``hydra_params`` and ``env_vars`` are typed
    loosely enough to hold a callable or an arbitrary object, which survives construction here and
    then fails inside ``model_dump(mode="json")`` at submit time — a ``PydanticSerializationError``
    raised from the transport, naming neither the runner nor the field. Checking here turns that
    into the refusal this module promises.
