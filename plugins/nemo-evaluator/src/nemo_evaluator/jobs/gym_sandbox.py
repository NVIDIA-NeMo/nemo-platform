"""Turn a submitted ``GymRunnerTarget`` into a sandboxed Gym host, service-side.

Whether a Gym evaluation is sandboxed is a property of the deployment, not of the job. The same
target runs colocated on a trusted dev box and sandboxed on a shared cluster, so nothing here is
authorable by a submitter: the rollout URL and token do not exist until a session is provisioned,
and the PVC claims, images and egress policy are cluster facts. Customizer settled this the same
way for GRPO, which keeps one submit contract across both.

What the job *does* supply is the environment selection, and that maps onto Gym's own configuration
mechanism without needing to understand its schema. Gym resolves ``config_paths`` itself, after
merging whatever initial config it is handed, so the selection travels as a list of YAML paths and
Gym loads them inside the sandbox where the environment is mounted.
