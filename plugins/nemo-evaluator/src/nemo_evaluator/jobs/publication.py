"""Publish a finished evaluation run to Intake, when the spec asked for it.

Covers both shapes: ``publish_agent_eval_result`` for an agent-eval run, and
``publish_row_eval_result`` for a dataset-driven one, which is adapted to the same
``AgentEvalResult`` shape first (see ``intake.row_adapter``).

``publish_to_intake`` is deliberately not a side effect of ``AgentEvaluator.run()`` (AALGO-290):
optionality is structural, you call it or you don't. ``spec.publication.intake`` keeps that shape —
absent means no publish, and nothing here runs — while giving the job API a way to request it, which
is what Studio needs to get evaluation runs into Experiments.

``run`` is synchronous and the publisher is async, so the call goes through the same
``run_with_isolated_async_sdk`` bridge ``result_persistence`` uses for the entity write.
