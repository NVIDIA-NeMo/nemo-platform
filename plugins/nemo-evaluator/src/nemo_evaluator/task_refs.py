"""References to persisted tasksets and their resolution into inline tasks.

An agent-eval submission carries ``tasks`` as either an inline list of
:class:`~nemo_evaluator.jobs.agent_spec.AgentEvalTaskInput` or a
:class:`~nemo_evaluator.api.schemas.TasksetRef` pointing at a stored taskset. During spec resolution
(``AgentEvalJob.to_spec``) a taskset reference is loaded from storage and its member tasks are
expanded into the same inline task DTOs, so the rest of the pipeline (metric-ref resolution, the
canonical :class:`~nemo_evaluator.jobs.agent_spec.AgentEvalSpec`) only ever sees inline tasks.

This mirrors :mod:`nemo_evaluator.metric_refs`: references are loaded here, next to the entity types,
so the job's ``to_spec`` stays a thin orchestration over ref-resolution helpers.
