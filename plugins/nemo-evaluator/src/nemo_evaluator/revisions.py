"""Publishing and resolving revisions of tasks and tasksets.

A *head* record (``TaskEntity`` / ``TasksetEntity``) holds the current content plus revision
bookkeeping. Publishing freezes that content into an immutable *revision* child
(``TaskRevisionEntity`` / ``TasksetRevisionEntity``) addressed by a digest of the content, and
points the requested tags at it. Resolution goes the other way: a ref's ``#fragment`` — a tag or a
digest — becomes a concrete revision.

Two ways to address a revision, two lookup costs. A **tag** is a mutable pointer stored on the head
as ``tag → ordinal``, so resolving one is a direct child lookup with no query — which matters
because ``#latest`` is the common path. A **digest** is content-addressed and resolved by querying
the children on ``(parent, content_hash)``. Nothing is denormalized: the head stores only pointers,
never a copy of what the children already say.

Concurrency. Two publishers racing on the same record both compute ordinal N; the entity store's
parent-scoped uniqueness — unique within ``(workspace, entity_type, parent, name)`` — makes the
second ``rev.N`` create conflict rather than silently duplicate. The loser refreshes its allocation
state and retries against N+1, keeping the content it was asked to publish. The child create, not
the head update, is the serialization point, so a revision is never allocated twice even if the
head update is slow.
