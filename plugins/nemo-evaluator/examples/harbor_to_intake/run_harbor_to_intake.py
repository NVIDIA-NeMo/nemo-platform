"""Pull a benchmark from Harbor Hub, run it in Docker, publish the scores to Intake.

Four steps, in order:

1. ``harbor download`` pulls each task from Harbor Hub into one directory of task
   folders — the layout the SDK's Harbor runtime already consumes.
2. :class:`AgentEvaluator` scores the tasks against a Harbor runner that executes
   each one in Docker.
   The default agent is ``codex``, working inside the task container, so what gets
   published is a real trajectory. ``--agent oracle`` replays each task's bundled
   reference solution instead: no credentials, 1.0 on everything, and a
   single-step trajectory, since a replay has no agent turns to record.
3. The Experiment and Evaluation are created up front, because ATIF ingest
   rejects a name the platform has not seen and ``publish_to_intake`` never
   creates one itself.
4. :func:`publish_to_intake` writes one ATIF trajectory per trial and one
   evaluator-result row per metric output, then the script reads them back
   through the Intake API to show what landed.

Prerequisites (see ``README.md``): Python >= 3.12 with the ``harbor`` extra, a
running Docker daemon, a platform running at least ``auth,entities,intake``, and —
for the default agent — a logged-in ``codex``.

Run it from the repository root::

    uv run plugins/nemo-evaluator/examples/harbor_to_intake/run_harbor_to_intake.py
