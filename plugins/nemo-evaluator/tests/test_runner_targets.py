#: * ``kind`` discriminates the target union.
#: * ``env_secrets`` holds references the service resolves into the job environment, so a *running*
#:   runner has already had them delivered as ordinary variables and has no reference to restate.
#: * ``agent_ref_name`` routes rollouts on the sandboxed host path only; the CLI runner resolves its
#:   agent from Gym config instead, so there is nothing on the runtime config to compare against.
