    Two behaviors are reproduced deliberately, because service logic depends on them:

    - **Parent-scoped uniqueness.** Records key on ``(entity_type, workspace, name, parent)``, which
      is what lets revision children of different tasks both be named ``rev.1`` while making a
      duplicate ordinal under one parent conflict.
    - **Optimistic locking.** ``update`` rejects a write whose ``db_version`` is stale. A fake that
      accepted every update would make correct retry logic untestable and broken retry logic look
      fine.
    - **Copy-on-read and copy-on-write.** Every record crosses the boundary as a deep copy, because
      the real client serializes over HTTP and cannot share objects with its caller. A fake that
      handed back the stored instance would let a service mutate the store just by touching an
      entity it read — so staging changes in memory and writing them later would be
      indistinguishable from writing them immediately, and a missing write would still pass.

    Signatures follow the *concrete* client (positional ``name``, optional ``parent``) rather than
    the narrower shared protocols, since that is what services actually call.
