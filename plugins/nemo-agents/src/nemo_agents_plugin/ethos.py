"""Lightweight ETHOS.md contract.

Ethos is a human-readable markdown file stored locally at
``agents/<name>-ethos/ETHOS.md`` and canonically in Filesets as
``<workspace>/<name>-ethos#ETHOS.md``.

Only the front matter and section outline are machine-validated here. The
section bodies remain markdown for humans and agents to read directly.

The schema records intent, not just a build-time inventory: how to weigh
competing wins (``Trade-offs``), what no change may cross (``Constraints``),
how to decide when no rule covers the case (``Principles``), what the
telemetry actually means (``Metric Semantics``), and where the agent is
headed (``Vision``). Mission and the result the agent is accountable for live
together in ``Purpose & Outcomes``.

Every body section is required. When a section has nothing to say, keep the
heading and write ``_(none)_`` rather than dropping it.

Four headings from the earlier AGENT-SPEC outline are retired rather than
required:

- ``Framework`` had no reader, and the container's framework label comes from
  ``agent.yaml``. Describe how the agent runs in ``Harness``, or write
  ``_(none)_``. Do not map the implementation onto a named platform harness.
- ``Model`` restated implementation the config already carries and went stale
  on the first model swap. Which models are *allowed* is a ``Constraints``
  entry; whether the loop may swap them is a ``Change Scope`` lever.
- ``Signals`` was a single consumer's configuration wearing a schema section.
  How a consumer reads evidence belongs in that consumer, not in this file.
- ``Purpose`` merged into ``Purpose & Outcomes``.

The same rule retired a drafted ``Budget`` section before it shipped: anything
that only configures one optimization run belongs to the tool running it, or
this file becomes a dumping ground that rots between runs.

A leftover retired heading is tolerated so a file can be filled in one section
at a time. If a ``Framework`` heading is still present, it must be resolved.
