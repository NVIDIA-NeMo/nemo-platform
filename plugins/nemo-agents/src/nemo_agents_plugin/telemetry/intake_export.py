"""Auto-wire an agent's Relay ATIF export to the platform's Intake ingest.

Filling in an export destination by hand is a poor thing to ask of anyone
writing an agent config: the reachable platform URL differs per deployment
context, and the same config should work whether it is deployed or run as a
job. So the backend wires it, and the config carries at most a name.

The two contexts differ only in how identity reaches Intake. A deployment
routes through a loopback auth-proxy sidecar that stamps the principal on the
way out. A job has one creator for its whole life and is handed that principal
directly, so it names environment variables the exporter reads instead.

    Takes the config as a mapping rather than an ``AgentConfig`` because the

    runtime, whose harnesses no longer round-trip through the model. The
    telemetry section does round-trip, so it is manipulated as a

    ``telemetry.enabled`` is tri-state: unset means "wire it for me", ``False``
    is an explicit opt-out, and ``True`` turns it on while still letting the
    backend fill in anything the config left out. An agent that already names
    its own ATIF storage keeps it — an explicit destination beats an inferred
    one.
