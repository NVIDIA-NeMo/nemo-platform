"""Agent gateway proxy routes.

Two proxy routes:

``/v2/workspaces/{workspace}/agents/{name}/-/{trailing_uri}``
    Proxy by **agent name** — gateway resolves the active deployment and
    forwards the request.  This is the primary user-facing path, analogous to
    how IGW routes by model name.

``/v2/workspaces/{workspace}/deployments/{name}/-/{trailing_uri}``
    Proxy by **deployment name** — for direct targeting of a specific
    deployment (e.g. A/B testing).

The ``/-/`` separator prevents URL conflicts with the CRUD routes
(``/agents/{name}`` and ``/deployments/{name}``).  This mirrors the pattern
used by the Inference Gateway.

Streaming and SSE are supported: the response is streamed back to the client
chunk by chunk.  ``text/event-stream`` responses bypass buffering.

Failures under the OpenAI-compatible ``/-/v1/*`` surface are rendered with an
OpenAI ``error`` envelope beside FastAPI's ``detail`` (see ``openai_errors``);
every other proxied path keeps ``detail`` alone.

#
# STOP-GAP: the shared deployment_routing helpers are the *only* place the agents
# plugin learns where a deployment lives. For subprocess deployments that is the loopback
# ``AgentDeployment.endpoint`` the agents plugin bakes in at spawn. For container
# deployments (docker/k8s) the real address (k8s Service DNS, docker host:port)
# is known only to the deployments plugin and projected onto ``endpoints`` by the
# agents controller. The rest of the proxy (streaming, SSE, header stripping, the
# SSRF origin guard in ``_proxy``) is mode-agnostic and untouched.
#
# POSSIBLE FUTURE DIRECTION: one option being considered is folding agent routing
# into the Inference Gateway (so IGW also serves as the agents gateway). If that
# direction is taken, this bespoke proxy and its deployment-routing helpers would likely retire.
# That re-architecture is not committed to here; this stop-gap stands on its own.

# Container modes (docker/k8s) resolve their address from the projected ``endpoints``
# rather than the loopback ``endpoint``. The agents controller maps the deployments-plugin
# Deployment.status (READY/...) onto the agents-local status, so a routable container
# deployment reads as "running" — the same value subprocess uses.
