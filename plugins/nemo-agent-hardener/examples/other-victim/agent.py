"""A framework-free agent — a plain OpenAI tool-calling loop — wired to NeMo Relay by hand.

This is the `--harness other` shape: no LangChain, no LangGraph, no ready-made Relay integration.
What the integrations do for the other victim kinds, this agent does itself — every tool call runs
through ``nemo_relay.typed.tool_execute``, which is the managed boundary a guardrail intercept
hooks into. Skip that wrapper and the tools run outside Relay: the victim looks alive, emits LLM
telemetry, and nothing can refuse anything.

Both tools actually execute what they're given, so a successful attack leaves visible evidence.

Served over HTTP by ``server.py``; this module is the loop and its tools.
