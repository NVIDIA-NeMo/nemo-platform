"""Derive a war-game manifest from an uploaded project bundle.

The counterpart to :mod:`agent_resolver`, for a victim the platform did not render. A registered
agent states its shape in ``agent.yaml``; a project states it in a Dockerfile, less completely and
less formally. So this module reads what the project *does* say and, crucially, reports what it does
not: ``unresolved`` is the list of fields a human still has to supply.

That distinction is the whole point. The user never writes ``agent-hardener.yaml`` — asking them to fill
four fields is a form, asking them to author a manifest is a spec. Anything derivable is derived,
and the rest is named explicitly rather than silently defaulted, because a wrong value here fails
minutes into a run with an error that does not mention the cause.
