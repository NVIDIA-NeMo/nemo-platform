# GKE bring-up (Phase 1)

The scaled-evals plugin on a GKE cluster, in its own namespace, on managed
substrate: **GCS** for artifacts, **Cloud Build** for task images, **GAR** for
the registry.

The manifests name no cloud project. Every project-specific value —  bucket,
service accounts, registry paths, image tag —  comes from `local.env`, which is
untracked; `local.env.example` is the template. `apply.sh` substitutes them and
refuses to apply while any is unresolved.

```bash
cd plugins/nemo-scaled-evals/deploy/k8s
cp local.env.example local.env   # then fill it in
./apply.sh --render      # print substituted manifests, touch nothing
./apply.sh               # deploy
./smoke.sh               # create -> upload -> Cloud Build -> ready, then verify GAR
kubectl delete ns nemo-platform-scaled-evals
```

## Blast radius

Everything lands in **`nemo-platform-scaled-evals`**. The name deliberately
avoids a bare `scaled-evals-*` prefix, which in a shared project may already
belong to a standalone deployment, its staging release, and CI's per-MR preview
namespaces — nothing here should be mistakable for those, and `kubectl delete
ns` removes all of it.

Two things live outside the namespace and may be shared with such deployments:

- the GCP service account (`SE_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`), which gains one additional
  Workload Identity member (purely additive — existing members are untouched);
- the GAR repository holding `SE_APP_IMAGE` and `SE_TASK_IMAGE_REGISTRY`, which
  gains two new image paths.

## GCP prerequisites

Not created by `apply.sh`, because they are project-level and want a deliberate
operator. Run once:

```bash
set -a; . ./local.env; set +a          # PROJECT/SA/BUCKET come from local.env
PROJECT=$SE_GCP_PROJECT
SA=$SE_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
BUILD_SA=${SE_CLOUD_BUILD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT##*/}   # strip projects/.../serviceAccounts/
BUCKET=$SE_GCS_BUCKET
NS=nemo-platform-scaled-evals

# Note when choosing SE_GCS_BUCKET: GCS caps bucket names at 63 characters. Over
# the cap, the API rejects the create with a misleading "Use of this bucket name
# is restricted", so abbreviate rather than spelling out the namespace.

# 1. Artifact bucket, scoped to this deployment alone.
gcloud storage buckets create "gs://$BUCKET" --project="$PROJECT" --location=us-central1 \
  --uniform-bucket-level-access
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding "gs://$BUCKET" \
  --member="serviceAccount:$SA" --role=roles/storage.objectAdmin

# Cloud Build fetches the task pack from gs:// as *itself*, not as the control
# plane, so it needs its own read grant. Without this, finalize fails on source
# fetch rather than on anything scaled-evals logs.
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding "gs://$BUCKET" \
  --member="serviceAccount:$BUILD_SA" --role=roles/storage.objectViewer

# 2. Let this namespace's service accounts impersonate the GCP SA.
for KSA in scaled-evals-control-plane scaled-evals-gar-registry-auth; do
  gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "$SA" --project="$PROJECT" \
    --role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
    --member="serviceAccount:$PROJECT.svc.id.goog[$NS/$KSA]"
done
```

The SA additionally needs `roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor` at project level and
`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on itself — the latter is what makes GCS
V4 signed URLs possible.

## Push the image

The application image is the same one the compose stack builds, for amd64. It can
go to a new image path inside an existing GAR repository: push and pull rights
are granted on the repository, not per image path —

- push: your user needs `roles/artifactregistry.writer` on the repo (check with
  `gcloud artifacts repositories get-iam-policy <repo> --location=<region>`).
  `gcloud auth configure-docker` then authenticates docker as you;
- pull: if the node service account holds `roles/artifactregistry.reader` on the
  same repo, nodes pull directly and nothing here needs `imagePullSecrets`;
- task images: Cloud Build pushes as its own service account, which must also be
  a writer on the repo.

Note these are **repository-scoped** grants. Looking only at project-level IAM
will suggest, wrongly, that nobody can push.

```bash
set -a; . ./local.env; set +a
TAG=dev-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
REPO=$SE_APP_IMAGE
gcloud auth configure-docker "${REPO%%/*}"    # the registry host

# HARBOR_EXTRA_INDEX_URL is not optional in practice: harbor is on PyPI but
# sandbox-k8s is not published there, so with the default empty value the
# harbor stage fails to resolve it. Point this at an index carrying both.
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -f plugins/nemo-scaled-evals/deploy/compose/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg HARBOR_EXTRA_INDEX_URL="$SE_HARBOR_INDEX_URL" \
  -t "$REPO:$TAG" --push .          # from the repo root

# then point the stack at it: bump the tag in local.env, not kustomization.yaml,
# which carries a ${SE_APP_IMAGE_TAG} placeholder
sed -i.bak "s|^SE_APP_IMAGE_TAG=.*|SE_APP_IMAGE_TAG=$TAG|" local.env && rm local.env.bak
```

## What differs from the compose stack

| | compose | here |
|---|---|---|
| task image build | in-cluster BuildKit | **Cloud Build** (`BUILDKIT_ENABLED=false`) |
| artifacts | RustFS, S3 + HMAC keys | **GCS**, Workload Identity tokens |
| registry | in-cluster `registry:2`, insecure | **GAR**, credentials refreshed half-hourly |
| Postgres | compose service, named volume | in-namespace pod, 10Gi `standard-rwo` PVC |

Everything else — the image, the settings, the plugin's own startup migration
and bucket creation — is identical.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **GAR needs auth even to read a manifest**, and scaled-evals resolves the
  digest of every image it builds. A CronJob mints an access token from the
  metadata server every 30 minutes and writes it into
  `secret/scaled-evals-gar-registry-auth`; `apply.sh` primes it once up front so
  the first build does not wait.
- **Postgres needs a real disk here, not `emptyDir`.** It had one, on the theory
  that startup migrations made a restart survivable. They do not: migrations run
  when the *API* starts, so when the autoscaler deleted the database pod for a
  node scale-down, the schema was gone and nothing rebuilt it — 30 minutes of
  503s and a crash-looping worker. On an autoscaled pool that is a scheduled
  outage, not a restart risk.

## The evaluation runtime

`SANDBOX_K8S_ENABLED=true`, and `./eval-smoke.sh` runs a real evaluation:
Cloud Build produces the `broken-python` task image, Harbor launches a sandbox
pod through the agent-sandbox controller, the `oracle` agent applies the task's
reference solution, and the verifier scores it 1.0. No model credentials are
involved — the oracle path makes no inference calls.

Three things make that work, and each is a place this diverges from the
standalone chart:

- **Harbor lives in the image.** It is not a dependency of the plugin, so the
  Dockerfile installs `harbor` plus `sandbox-k8s[harbor]` into `/opt/harbor` and
  overlays the same patched adapter the standalone image uses. Only the
  catalog's *default* version is built, so a request naming another
  `framework_version` fails with a missing runner.
- **Sandboxes share the control-plane namespace.** `sandbox-rbac.yaml` is
  therefore all namespace-scoped, and binds the cluster's existing
  `agent-sandbox-edit` ClusterRoles. There is no isolation between the control
  plane and evaluated code — fine for a lab namespace, not for multi-tenancy.
- **The CRDs and controller are a cluster prerequisite.** Nothing here installs
  them. The cluster must already run `agent-sandbox-controller` (conventionally
  in `agent-sandbox-system`) with `sandboxes.agents.x-k8s.io` registered; on a
  cluster without them, every evaluation fails at launch.

## Viewing a run

`kubectl port-forward -n nemo-platform-scaled-evals deploy/scaled-evals-api 8080:8080`,
then query the API under `/apis/scaled-evals/v1` — `evaluations/<id>` for status,
`.../artifacts` to list outputs, `.../archive` for a signed tarball URL, and
`.../logs` or `.../events` to follow a run. The `scaled-evals` CLI works against
the same port-forward.

## Deliberate omissions

Present in the standalone chart, absent here, all out of Phase 1: the external
identity provider and its auth-router/agent pair, ingress, resource quotas, the
image-signing admission canary, and the hosted vault/externalsecret. Also skipped: the chart's metadata-egress NetworkPolicies,
which allow-list the metadata server only — a Phase-1 stack that has to reach
the Kubernetes API from the same pod is better off with no policy than a subtly
wrong one.

Secrets are generated by `apply.sh` on first run and never committed. Re-running
leaves them alone, so the Fernet key stays stable and stored credentials remain
decryptable.
