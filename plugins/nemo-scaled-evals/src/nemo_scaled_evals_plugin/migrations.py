"""Apply the vendored scaled-evals SQL to the plugin's own Postgres.

This replaces the three shell+psql call sites the standalone repo used (compose
entrypoint, `schema-migrate` compose service, Helm `schema-init` Job), none of
which came across with the vendored code. Semantics are copied from that Job:
load `db/schema` **only** on a fresh database, then apply every `db/migrations`
file in filename order, every time.

Re-applying the whole migration set on each boot looks wasteful but is the
upstream contract: the set has no version ledger, and each file is written to be
re-appliable (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `to_regclass` early-exit, and so on).
Standalone CI proves it by applying the set twice; `tests/test_migrations.py`
keeps that guarantee here.
