"""A mock email phishing analyzer, exposed as an MCP stdio server, that replays canned results.

The ``optimize-mcp.yaml`` study tunes the Hermes coordinator that calls this tool, not the analyzer,
so the analyzer is a fixture: each row of ``dataset-mcp.json`` carries the ``analysis`` the real
analyzer returned for that email (recorded with ``optimize-mcp.yaml``), and this server hands it
back when the agent passes that email. To add a task, run ``optimize-mcp.yaml`` on the new email once and
store the analyzer's result in the row.

Because the reply is keyed on the email text, an agent that edits, truncates or paraphrases the
email gets an ``unknown`` verdict instead of a confident one. That is the input-binding check the
system prompt's "copy verbatim" instruction relies on.
