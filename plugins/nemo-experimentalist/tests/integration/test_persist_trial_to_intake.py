"""Integration test: `_persist_trial` against a real Intake service and ClickHouse.

The unit tests for these paths drive hand-written doubles, so they would keep passing if
the generated SDK method were renamed or changed shape. This exercises the whole chain —
backend, typed SDK, Intake, ClickHouse — and reads the trace back through the SDK.

Run directly::

    uv run pytest plugins/nemo-experimentalist/tests/integration/test_persist_trial_to_intake.py -v
