"""M1's acceptance bar: every seam is swappable from config, with no code change.

The milestone claims the core is done. The test of that claim is that a new
optimization paradigm — HPO next — needs no edit to the strategy or to any existing
component. If a role cannot be named in config and resolved, that claim is false, and
this file says so rather than leaving it to be discovered when HPO is written.

Resolution alone is not the bar: a component that resolves and then fails on its
constructor is not swappable, so construction through the context is asserted too.
