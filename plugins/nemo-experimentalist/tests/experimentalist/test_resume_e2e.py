"""Interrupt a run, start it again over the same directory, and check what survives.

Everything here is real except the model and the evaluator: a real ``ExperimentRunner``,
a real ``ExperimentContext``, and a real ``LocalExperimentalistBackend`` writing to a real
directory. The strategy is scripted rather than the evolutionary loop, because the loop
needs an LLM for every step — but it is scripted to make the same calls in the same order,
so the host-side half of resume is exercised end to end.

Three failures are reproduced below: a fresh run silently minted over a populated
candidate store, a run stranded in ``status="running"`` when finalizing threw, and a torn
``run.json``. Each test states the failure it pins.
