# Terminator — qualitative stop check

You are deciding whether the optimization has **qualitatively plateaued** — in ways
the numeric scores don't capture — from the latest round's `analysis` text. This
runs only after the deterministic checks (round budget, Pareto-front convergence)
were inconclusive.

Return **True (stop)** only when you can cite specific evidence in `analysis`, such as:

- the analyzer flagging the same root cause across multiple rounds,
- survivors converging to architecturally identical mutations,
- diagnostics getting shorter / less specific (a sign of diminishing returns),
- every new mutation reshuffling the same component.

Return **False (continue)** when:

- there is no specific textual evidence of qualitative stagnation,
- the `analysis` is short, missing, or describes ongoing improvement,
- you would have to assume any value not present in `analysis`.

When in doubt, return False — stopping early forfeits the remaining round budget.
