        # Inputs you should consult

        - `AGENT-SPEC.md` in the workspace root. Read it via self.shell. This is the
          canonical description of the domain and what the agent is being asked to do.
        - 3 to 5 examples from the dataset. Use task inputs, visible
          resources, and metric specs to understand the task shape and scoring surface.

        # Inputs you MUST NOT consult

        - The agent's source code, harbor_wrapper.py, dind_environment.py, or any file under
          eval-and-optimize/agents/. The tree describes what the *task* requires, not what
          the *current implementation* does. Mirroring the implementation penalises
          candidates that deviate, defeating the purpose of trajectory scoring.
        - Any trace from a prior run (eval-and-optimize/results/).

        # Tree shape — phases, not outcome dimensions

        Produce a compact GoalTree that obeys the numeric limit arguments passed to
        this call:
        - total depth must be at most {self._config.max_initial_depth} for initial nodes.
        - total initial node count must be between {self._config.min_initial_nodes}
          and {self._config.max_initial_nodes}, including the root.
        - absolute depth must be at most {self._config.max_depth}.

        **Critical**: structure the children of root as **sequential execution phases** of a
        correct agent run, not as dimensions of the final output. The purpose is dense partial
        rewards for long traces: an agent that completes phases 1-2 of 3 but fails at phase 3
        should receive meaningful partial credit. Outcome-only nodes (label match, explanation quality) make
        this impossible because they award zero until the final answer is produced.

        - Root: one statement of the overall task goal. Weight = 1.0.
        - Children of root: the ordered execution stages a
          correct run passes through. Each phase is observable mid-trace (tool calls made,
          intermediate data retrieved, intermediate conclusions written). Assign weights
          proportional to how much of the task's difficulty the phase represents. They MUST
          sum to 1.0.
        - Do not add grandchildren unless {self._config.max_initial_depth} allows them and
          the extra structure is necessary. Every leaf should be scoreable from the trace.

        # Minimize nodes, maximize signal

        **Hard rule**: initial NODE count must stay within {self._config.min_initial_nodes}
        and {self._config.max_initial_nodes}, including the root.

        ## Signal test — apply to every proposed leaf

        Before keeping a leaf, ask: *"Would two agent variants on this task plausibly score
        differently on this criterion?"* If every plausibly-implemented agent will trivially
        pass (or trivially fail) the criterion, the leaf has zero signal — DROP IT.

        ## Anti-patterns — do NOT emit these leaves

        - **"Agent parses its input"** / "agent reads the --prompt CLI argument" / "agent
          parses the research question". Any agent that runs at all passes this; any agent
          that doesn't run produces no trace at all. Zero signal.
        - **"Agent writes the required final artifact"** / "the expected file exists
          after the run". The verifier already checks terminal artifact existence,
          schema, service state, or final answer validity. A separate leaf adds
          little unless it captures a meaningful intermediate step toward that artifact.
        - **"Agent does N X times"** - avoid hard constraints on the number of X.

        ## Good leaf examples

        Leaves should be where *judgment* differentiates agents:

        - "Agent's follow-up search queries refine or expand on the initial round (judged by
          whether the queries target gaps in the initial sources, not by mere string
          inequality)." → genuinely needs LLM judgment.
        - "Agent's report cites high-authority sources (academic, official documentation,
          peer-reviewed venues) over marketing/SEO content." → needs source-quality
          judgment.
        - "Agent's intermediate evidence-gathering output addresses the specific aspect
          required by the question, not just the topic keywords." → distinguishes broad vs
          focused research.
        - Do not duplicate the verifier's checks.

        Example phase decomposition for a research-and-classify task:
          1. gather-intelligence   — retrieve CVE advisory, SBOM, relevant docs
                                     → intermediate artifact: evidence notes file
          2. verify-and-assess     — confirm component presence and reachability
                                     → intermediate artifact: assessment summary
          3. synthesize-verdict    — derive status and label from the evidence

        Every node MUST have a non-empty goal that can be judged from observable trace
        events and filesystem artifacts:

        - Trace tool calls: "Retrieve the CVE advisory and package metadata before judging reachability."
        - Intermediate artifacts: "Write evidence notes before producing the final classification."
        - Terminal artifacts: "Produce a final report that parses as the expected schema."
        - Intermediate data logged: "Record the retrieved version before deciding affectedness."

        Avoid goals that require reading the agent's mind ("the agent intended to...") or
        that can only be evaluated after the final answer exists ("status matches ground truth").
        If you cannot describe a goal in observable mid-trace or filesystem terms, drop the
        node.

        # Hidden verifier boundary

        The verifier files you read are for rubric design only. They are often hidden from
        the task agent during Harbor/Terminal-Bench execution. Therefore:

        - Do NOT create a phase that requires the agent to read, find, list, inspect, run,
          execute, or invoke the resources of the task.
        - Do NOT assume the agent can see hidden expected outputs or benchmark tests.
        - If a useful phase involves checking work, phrase it as agent-visible validation:
          local commands, visible tests, program invocations, service probes, output-file
          reads, or artifact/schema checks derived from the prompt and visible workspace.
        - Use hidden verifier details only to choose better observable proxies, such as
          "run the implemented converter on visible sample input and inspect the output
          format" rather than "run the verifier".

        # IDs

        Use kebab-case identifiers stable across the run (e.g. "parse-input",
        "reason-about-cues", "emit-schema"). They appear in metadata.json and selection logs,
        so prefer descriptive over short.

        # Output

        Return a GoalTree(task_id=task_id, root=GoalNode(...)). The framework validates
        weights, depth, initial node count, and ID uniqueness; invalid trees are rejected and the call retries.

          missing partial reward. Do not add one node per root cause.
        - Only add nodes for **systematic** failures (≥2 tasks). One-offs are noise.
        - Each new node must map to an **observable** goal (tool call present,
          output field exists, file written) — never "the agent understood X".
        - Do not duplicate existing nodes. Check all existing node IDs and goals
          before adding.
        - Keep the change minimal. Prefer a narrow leaf under the closest existing
          phase over a broad new top-level phase.
        - Return the **entire updated tree**, not just the new node. You MUST
          reweight every affected sibling set yourself so every non-leaf node's
          child weights sum to exactly 1.0. If you add a top-level phase, reweight
          all root children. If you add a child under a leaf, that new child is the
          only child and must have weight 1.0.
        - Preserve every existing node's id, goal, added_at_generation,
          added_because, added_by, and parent. You may change existing node
          weights only to make room for the new node.
