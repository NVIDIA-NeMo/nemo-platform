"""What a component sees of the run, and the working copy a Builder builds in.

Protocols rather than the concrete context, so a role contract does not import the
implementation: naming ``ExperimentContext`` in :mod:`roles` closes an import cycle
through the backend, the config tree, and every component config slice. It also lets an
out-of-tree strategy type its own ``run`` without importing our internals.
