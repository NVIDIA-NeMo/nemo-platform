"""E2E tests for the nemo-deployments plugin against a real Docker daemon.

Where ``test_nemo_agents_docker.py`` exercises the *agents* surface (which uses
the deployments plugin under the hood for a single opinionated agent container),
this module exercises the deployments plugin's **own** public API directly:
DeploymentConfig / Deployment / Volume CRUD plus the reconcile controller that
turns those entities into real Docker containers and volumes. The
backend-agnostic scenario cores are shared with the Kubernetes variant
(``test_nemo_deployments_k8s.py``) via ``e2e.deployments_helpers``; this module
owns only the docker-specific wiring.

What it proves — the deployments reconcile chain end to end, on Docker::

    sdk._client POST /apis/deployments/v2/...   (config / volume / deployment)
      -> deployments reconcile controller
      -> docker executor creates the container / named volume
      -> Deployment.status converges (READY for the nginx service,
         SUCCEEDED for the alpine job and the volume round-trip job)

How it runs, and where:

- The platform runs as a normal local process (subprocess harness) wired with a
  nemo-deployments Docker executor (see ``e2e/configs/local-docker-deployments.yaml``).
  The harness runs both the deployments service and its reconcile controller.
- The workloads use small public images (``alpine`` / ``nginx``); the executor
  pulls them on demand (``pull_images: true`` in the config), so no prebuilt
  ``nmp-api`` image is needed here — hence no ``needs_nmp_api_image`` marker.
  The image refs are env-overridable (see ``e2e.deployments_helpers``) to match
  the ``POSTGRES_IMAGE`` / ``BUSYBOX_IMAGE`` knobs the k8s e2e install exposes,
  should a DockerHub mirror ever be introduced.
- ``subprocess_only``: this module drives its own subprocess-harness platform
  configured with a docker deployments executor. It must NOT run against an
  external cluster (``NMP_BASE_URL`` set), where its ``e2e_config`` / harness are
  ignored and no docker executor exists.
- Docker-only workloads run on the host daemon directly. Unlike the agents docker
  test, nothing here needs the docker-bridge base-url rewrite (no in-container
  callback to the platform), so there is no ``container_base_url_host`` harness
  option and no Linux-only skip is strictly required — but a working Docker
  daemon is. The module skips cleanly if the daemon is unreachable.
