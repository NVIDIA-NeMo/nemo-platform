"""E2E tests for Insights analysis runs backed by ``agents.execute`` jobs.

This is the platform-side replacement for running the Analyst from an
operator's shell: everything here goes through the ``analysis-runs`` API, so
passing it means the path works on a remotely-deployed platform, where nobody
can run ``nemo agents analyst run`` locally.

The Analyst's model is mocked, deliberately. What is under test is the wiring —
run recorded, job submitted under the run's name, Fabric runs the inline
Analyst, the ``insights.analysis`` extension persists the change-set and saves
the report — not whether a real model reaches a good conclusion. The Analyst is
a Nooa CodeAct agent, so one mocked ``execute_python`` tool call carrying a
``return_result(...)`` cell drives a complete, deterministic run.
