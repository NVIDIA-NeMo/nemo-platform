"""Shared helpers for nemo-deployments plugin e2e tests.

Both the Docker (``test_nemo_deployments_docker.py``) and Kubernetes
(``test_nemo_deployments_k8s.py``) modules drive the *deployments plugin's own*
public API end to end — DeploymentConfig / Deployment / Volume CRUD plus the
reconcile controller that turns those entities into real backend resources
(Docker containers+volumes, or Kubernetes Job/Deployment+Service+PVC).

The chain they prove::

    sdk._client POST /apis/deployments/v2/.../deployment-configs   (template)
    sdk._client POST /apis/deployments/v2/.../volumes              (optional PVC/volume)
    sdk._client POST /apis/deployments/v2/.../deployments          (desired state)
      -> deployments reconcile controller
      -> executor backend (docker | k8s) creates the real workload
      -> Deployment.status converges (READY for services, SUCCEEDED for jobs)

Unlike ``e2e/agents_deploy_helpers.py`` (which goes through the higher-level
``sdk.agents`` surface), the deployments plugin is not exposed on the typed SDK,
so this module talks to the REST API directly via ``sdk._client``. The
per-backend modules own only what genuinely differs: pytest markers, the backend
key passed to volume/deployment ``backend_config``, and any best-effort reaping
of leaked backend resources.
