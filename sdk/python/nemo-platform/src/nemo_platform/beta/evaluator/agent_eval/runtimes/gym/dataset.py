    are stashed under ``inputs['gym_row']`` for provenance; and it is scored by a
    :class:`GymRewardMetric`. The dataset path is stamped on
    ``metadata['gym_dataset_path']``, and every *other* row key (the verifier's
    ground-truth fields, ``agent_ref``, and so on) on ``metadata['gym_row_extras']``.
    Together with ``inputs['gym_row']`` those reconstruct the complete source row,
    which :class:`GymAgentTaskRunner` re-materializes into the dataset it hands to Gym.

    **One distinct row is one task.** Duplicate rows collapse (identity is row content,
    so they are by definition the same task) and are reported as a warning: repeated
    attempts are a run-level concern — ``GymRuntimeConfig.num_repeats`` — not something
    a dataset expresses by repeating a row, so duplicates almost always mean bad data.

    **A row need not carry a prompt.** A sweep of the 106 built-in environments shipping example
    data found 5 — ``aviary``, ``gdpval``, ``legal_agent_bench``, ``scicode`` and ``toolsandbox``

    key rather than a fabricated one, and is counted in a summary log line. This costs the
    Gym path nothing: the runner never reads ``instruction`` — it re-materializes the source
    row from ``inputs['gym_row']`` + ``metadata['gym_row_extras']`` and hands *that* to Gym,
    and ``intent`` is a dataset label either way. It stays absent (not ``""``) so that
    :meth:`AgentEvalTask.agent_prompt` still fails loudly for the runners that *do* need a
    prompt — an instruction-less task must not reach an agent as an empty one.

    ``responses_create_params`` itself remains required: Gym indexes into it unconditionally
    (``rollout_collection._preprocess_rows_from_config``), so a row without it is rejected here
    rather than crashing Gym mid-collection.
