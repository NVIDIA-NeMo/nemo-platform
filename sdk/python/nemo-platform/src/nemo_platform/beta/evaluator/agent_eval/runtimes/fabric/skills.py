"""Agent-skill injection for the Fabric agent-eval runtimes (PROTOTYPE).

An *agent skill* is a directory following the `agentskills.io <https://agentskills.io/specification>`_
spec: a folder named ``<name>/`` containing a required ``SKILL.md`` (YAML frontmatter with ``name`` +
``description``, then instructions) plus optional ``scripts/`` / ``references/`` / ``assets/``. We make
that bundle available to the harness before it runs a task so an A/B eval can score the same taskset
with and without the skill. The skill is a runtime-level knob: build one runtime with ``skill=None``
and one with ``skill=<AgentSkill>`` over the same tasks, then diff the scores.

An :class:`AgentSkill` points at a local skill directory; staging is an OS-level ``copytree`` (file
contents never pass through Python memory). The plugin resolves a platform fileset to a local
directory and constructs an ``AgentSkill`` from it — the SDK has no fileset concept of its own.

How the skill reaches the harness depends on the selected Fabric adapter, and which mode applies is
decided by *querying Fabric's own capability planner at runtime* (:func:`resolve_skill_mode` over a
``RunPlan.capability_plan``), not a hardcoded adapter list — so it tracks whatever the installed
adapters declare, including end-user adapters we don't ship:

* **Native** (:data:`SKILL_MODE_NATIVE`): the adapter advertises ``accepts: ["skills", ...]``, so
  Fabric's planner routes skills to ``harness_native``. We stage the bundle into an isolated
  ``<name>/`` dir and add it to the config's ``skills.paths``; the adapter loads it (Hermes → harness
  ``skills.external_dirs``). As of nemo-fabric 0.1.0rc3 the hermes, claude AND **codex** adapters all
  declare ``skills``, so this is the path every harness we ship currently takes.
* **Codex skills dir** (:data:`SKILL_MODE_CODEX_SKILLS_DIR`): a fallback for a codex-harness adapter
  that does *not* accept the native skills config. The Codex CLI itself discovers agentskills bundles
  from ``.agents/skills/`` in its working directory, so we place the bundle at
  ``<workspace>/.agents/skills/<name>/`` and let Codex find it — same discoverable-skill semantics as
  native (cross-harness A/B stays apples-to-apples), no Fabric adapter change needed.
  NOTE: the shipped codex adapter accepts ``skills`` today, so this branch is currently unreachable in
  production and is exercised only by the fake-backed tests. It is kept for adapters (ours or an
  end-user's) that route skills ``unsupported`` on a codex harness.

If an adapter neither routes skills natively nor is a Codex harness, :func:`resolve_skill_mode` returns
``None`` and the runtime fails fast rather than silently running a skill-free trial.
