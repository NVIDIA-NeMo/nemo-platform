/**
 * The single canonical glyph for every entity Studio represents.
 *
 * One entity means one icon, everywhere it appears — sidebar nav, route header,
 * empty state, primary CTA. Import from here rather than reaching for
 * `lucide-react` at the callsite: a locally chosen glyph is how the surfaces
 * drifted apart in the first place (ASTD-447).
 *
 * Choosing a glyph for a new entity:
 * - Reuse the parent's glyph for a sub-entity the user reads as part of the
 *   parent (`guardrails` / `guardrailChecks`), or the parent's family where the
 *   two are genuinely distinct (`telemetryTraces` / `telemetrySpans`).
 * - Never reuse a glyph already spoken for by an *unrelated* entity. Two
 *   unrelated entities on one glyph means neither one owns it.
 *
 * Not every entity here has an empty state yet — this map is the superset, and
 * `ENTITY_EMPTY_STATES` covers whichever subset has migrated onto
 * {@link EntityEmptyState}.
