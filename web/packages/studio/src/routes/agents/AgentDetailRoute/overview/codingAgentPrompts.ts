    `- Otherwise pick the ingest format that matches what the agent actually emits — OTLP (OpenInference or OTel GenAI semantic conventions), chat completions, or ATIF. Read the skill's comparison table before choosing; do not default to generic OpenTelemetry spans.`,
    `- Every span must carry the agent name \`${agentName(params)}\` exactly as it is named in NeMo Platform (\`gen_ai.agent.name\`, or \`llm.agent.name\` / \`agent.name\` depending on the convention your instrumentation emits). This is the name I created the agent under in Studio, not whatever name the agent's own code, framework, or class defaults to — override it if they differ. Studio's agent overview is keyed on this exact value — if it is missing, inconsistent, or does not match \`${agentName(params)}\` verbatim, the traces land but the agent page stays empty.`,
    `- Set a stable session ID so multi-turn runs group into one session.`,
    `- Assume volume. Ingest them in batches, keep going after a single bad record, and tell me how many landed versus how many were skipped and why.`,
    `- My exports are probably not clean. Expect mixed shapes, one-trace-per-file directories, JSONL, gzipped archives, extra wrapper keys, or missing agent names. Write a small throwaway script to normalize them before ingesting rather than asking me to hand-edit files.`,

Enabling it first risks a scheduled run firing while the manual pass is still in flight — the platform only guards against overlapping *scheduled* runs, not a manual CLI run:`,
