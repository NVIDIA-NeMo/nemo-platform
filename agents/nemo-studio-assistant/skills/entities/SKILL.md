Entity tasks

- Use `nemo_api` with the `models` or `datasets` resource as appropriate, passing
  `workspace="<active request workspace>"` on every call.
- Use the exact entity type and name from the instruction.
- For model/dataset CRUD, create the temporary entity, verify/list/update/delete it, then create the final verification entity.
- Keep JSON params valid and compact. Final dataset checks often require fields such as `format` and `size` to match exactly.
- Retrieve or list the final model or dataset and compare every required field,
  including its exact entity type and name, before reporting success.
