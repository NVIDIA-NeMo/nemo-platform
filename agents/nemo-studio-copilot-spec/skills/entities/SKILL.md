Entity tasks

- Use `nemo_api` with the `models` or `datasets` resource as appropriate.
- Use the exact entity type and name from the instruction.
- For model/dataset CRUD, create the temporary entity, verify/list/update/delete it, then create the final verification entity.
- Keep JSON params valid and compact. Final dataset checks often require fields such as `format` and `size` to match exactly.
