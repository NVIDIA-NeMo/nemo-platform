# Dev-only: install the `nemo-relay` GATEWAY BINARY, the one Fabric eval dependency that cannot come
# from a wheel. It is required for live ATIF trajectory capture on out-of-process harnesses (codex).
#
# Everything else is in the lock — `uv sync --extra fabric` installs the nemo-fabric SDK, the
# codex/claude/deepagents adapters, and the nemo-relay Python bindings. The pip `nemo-relay` package
# is bindings-only (its wheel declares no console script and contains no executable), so the daemon is
# published solely as a GitHub release asset.
#
# The version defaults to the `nemo-relay` bindings installed in the venv, so the daemon and the
# bindings cannot drift apart when the lock moves.
#
# To run against an unreleased Fabric instead of the locked wheels, install the checkout directly:
#   uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python "/path/to/NeMo-Fabric[codex,relay,runtime]"
# and `uv sync --extra fabric` to get back to the locked state. (That needs cargo — Fabric builds a
# Rust/pyo3 extension from source.)
#
# A live codex run additionally needs the `codex` CLI + `codex login` auth.
# See plugins/nemo-evaluator/docs/design/fabric-runner-integration.md.
#
# Usage:
#   script/dev-install-fabric.sh                                # version matching the installed bindings
#   NEMO_RELAY_VERSION=0.6.0-rc.4 script/dev-install-fabric.sh   # pin a specific gateway release
