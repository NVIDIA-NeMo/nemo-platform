# Regenerate the partial dependency constraints used by CI's wheel install-smoke-test
# (.github/wheel-constraints/*.txt).
#
# Why partial (constraints, not a full lock): the smoke test installs the freshly
# built nemo-platform / nemo-platform-plugin wheels. Without any pin it resolves
# the whole tree fresh from PyPI (non-reproducible, supply-chain risk). A FULL
# lock does not work here — the vendored-SDK wheel needs newer deps than
# uv.lock. So we pin each wheel's DIRECT external deps (the versions we've
# vetted), plus any pre-release transitive (uv resolves a pre-release only for a
# package it is told about by name), and let the remaining deep transitives
# resolve normally, so they cannot self-conflict.
#
# Usage:
#   script/compile-wheel-constraints.sh <dir-with-both-wheels>
#
# Wheels come from `uv build --package nemo-platform[-plugin]` (nemo-platform
# needs the Studio/node toolchain) or a CI "<pkg>-wheel-py3.12" artifact
# (`gh run download <run-id> -n nemo-platform-wheel-py3.12 -D <dir>`).

# uv accepts a pre-release version only for a package named in a first-party requirement or
# constraint, and a pre-release dependency can reach the wheel transitively. Feed the
# pre-releases uv.lock already resolved in as constraints, and pin them in the output too, so
# neither the snapshot below nor CI's install has to fall back to a global --prerelease=allow
# (which would also drag in pre-releases of unrelated transitives).
