"""nmp-rl-training image import smoke tests.

Built as part of the docker-bake.hcl bake group (smoke-test stage) and run on a CPU runner —
no GPU hardware required.

Two failure classes are caught at .so load time, before any GPU device is touched:

  ModuleNotFoundError  — package missing from the environment (e.g. a platform-glue dependency
                         that did not resolve, or a source tree excluded from a layer)

  ImportError          — CUDA extension .so has an undefined symbol; the wheel/build was compiled
                         against a different PyTorch version than the one installed (ABI mismatch)

WHICH ENVIRONMENT EACH IMPORT BELONGS TO
----------------------------------------
NeMo-RL does not run training in the image's base venv. Every Ray actor launches with its own
per-node venv under /opt/ray_venvs (see docker/rl/README.md, "How NeMo-RL runs"). The base venv
holds only the default dependency set, because each ``uv sync --extra`` during the build prunes
the previous extra's packages.

So ``import vllm`` from the base venv is *expected* to fail and would prove nothing. These tests
run each import in the venv that actually owns the package, using that venv's own interpreter.
