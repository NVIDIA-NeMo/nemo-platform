# Identity Provider References

This directory contains NeMo Platform identity-provider reference bundles.

Each provider bundle defines one contract for local validation and production
adaptation:

- expose OIDC discovery metadata
- include a gateway layer that strips inbound `X-NMP-Principal-*` headers
- define one human identity and one machine identity for shared auth testing
- treat external machine identities as ordinary OIDC principals authorized by
  group binding, not as internal `service:*` principals
- document provider-specific setup in a local `README.md`

Managed job OBO tests use the provider for user and controller authentication,
but the workload-to-submitter binding is NeMo Platform auth state. Jobs receive
`NMP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`, exchange that subject token through
`/apis/auth/token`, and receive a NeMo Platform token whose top-level subject
is the job submitter and whose RFC 8693 `act.sub` is the workload actor. Provider
manifests may include workload-provider token grants for contract tests, but
managed Docker job OBO must not depend on provider-specific fields such as
`jti`.

Open-source providers with `mode: compose-ci` are intended for the shared auth
matrix. Reference-only providers stay documented and manifest-driven but are
excluded from the local Compose-backed matrix.
