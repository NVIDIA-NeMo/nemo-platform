# Build an installable nemo-gym wheel for the Gym per-server venvs.
#
# Gym rewrites the install line for any server directory that is NOT inside a Gym checkout --
# which a platform environment FileSet staged at /job/environment never is. It strips the editable
# line and substitutes `nemo-gym==<the parent venv's version>`, resolved from a package INDEX
# (nemo_gym/cli/setup_command.py, _get_nemo_gym_version_spec). This image runs the soluwalana fork,
# whose version is published nowhere, so that resolution has no candidate and every native-v1 job
# dies at server spin-up with "No solution found when resolving: nemo-gym" (nvbug 6716627).
#
# The pin is exact, so a wheel built at any other version is invisible to it and the job fails
# exactly as before -- hence the version check at the end.

# Upstream declares almost no package-data, relying on setuptools-scm's VCS file-finder to sweep
# the configs and READMEs into the wheel. That finder needs git, and there is none here: the RL
# source arrives by `ADD <repo>#<ref>`, which keeps no submodule .git (a submodule's .git is a
# gitdir pointer file, not a directory). Left alone the wheel builds and installs happily while
# quietly missing every YAML, including the sandbox provider configs. Declare the data explicitly
# rather than depend on VCS state this build cannot have.
